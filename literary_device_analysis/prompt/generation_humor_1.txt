You will receive a document and a set of top-level features from a feature hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable features within the document that can act as top-level features in the hierarchy. If any relevant features are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level features as identified in the document.

[Top-level features]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Satire"
Document:
FCC To Fine Americans Who Don't Keep Up With TV Shows

Your response:
[1] Satire: A literary device of writing or art which principally ridicules its subject often as an intended means of provoking or preventing change or highlighting a shortcoming in the work of another. Imitation, humor, irony, and exaggeration are often used to aid this.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Wordy", returning the existing feature
Document:
Her Dear John missive flapped unambiguously in the windy breeze, hanging like a pizza menu on the doorknob of my mind.

Your response:
[1] Wordy: Includes superfluous words, especially adjectives, that do not change the meaning of the sentence.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine features included in the document.
- The feature labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The features must reflect a SINGLE feature instead of a combination of features.
- The new features must have a level number, a short general label, and a feature description.
- The features must be broad enough to accommodate future subfeatures.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant features in the hierarchy, output those features and stop here.
2. If the document contains no features, return "None".
3. Otherwise, add your feature as a top-level feature. Stop here and output the added feature(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.
