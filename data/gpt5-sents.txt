High noon had overslept and was running late across the baked flapjack of the prairie when Sheriff Dusty "Two-Boots" McGraw (so named because one boot was jealous) clanked into the saloon, where the piano wheezed like an asthmatic coyote and tumbleweeds—city ones, mind you—sashayed indoors to order sarsaparilla with menacing foam.
It was a dry and dusty dawn in the town of Desolation Junction, where the sun rose like an overcooked yolk on a greasy skillet and the tumbleweeds—each a bewhiskered orphan—limped down Main Street past the saloon doors that burped regret, as Sheriff Lonesome Pete squinted his bullet-hole eyes at fate and missed.
It was the kind of evening that draped itself over the town like a velvet octopus soaked in moonlight, each glistening tentacle caressing shingles and secrets alike, while my heart, a baroque chandelier of feelings, trembled on its rusty chain, sprinkling teardrop prisms upon the puddled cobblestones of destiny's overenthusiastic foyer.
It was a dark and stormy knight—Sir Loin—who tenderly minced through the abattoir of my heart, his rare intentions well-done, as thyme after thyme he peppered me with currant events and grated expectations, letting us romaine calm while my sole searched for porpoise, a serial cereal killer whose crimes were bowl-derdash and wok of shame.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping its mayonnaise light upon the cobblestones of destiny, swanned through the velveteen night as my heart—a quivering soufflé of yearning, trepidation, and possibly gout—palpitated like a timid tambourine, while fate, corseted in brocade and cheap perfume, tiptoed loudly across the parquet of eternity, squeaking.
It was a moist and whispering dusk when Bradlynn, whose eyes were the color of avocado toast smeared with regret, saw Petunia across the laundromat of destiny, and their souls collided like two overloaded dryers shrieking with quarters, sparking a love that smelled faintly of warm polyester and forever, or at least until spin cycle.
It was a high noon so low it scraped its knuckles on the mesa, while the sun—squinting like a suspicious sheriff—pinned heat warrants on every tumbleweed in Dustpan Gulch (a town too small to spit in without hitting the future), as Cactus Jack rode in backwards to confuse destiny, which, frankly, wasn't paying attention.
It was love at first sight, the kind that lands like a damp swan on the tarmac of the heart, honking sonnets, when Bartholomew, whose eyes were the color of confused olives after a storm, noticed Priscilla, a widow of three houseplants, and felt destiny unzip itself clumsily like a cheap suitcase in an airport of passion.
It was a dark and stormy night on Proxima b, where the binary moons blinked like sleepy routers rebooting the cosmos, and Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum-fedora with a sigh so heavy it bent spacetime, uploading his feelings to the ship's melancholic AI, which replied with buffering ellipses and a single, ominous emoji.
It was the dawn of 1215 and the sun rose over Runnymede like a boiled egg escaping its shell, while King John, sweaty as a banquet ham and twice as salty, hovered his quill like a nervous woodpecker over the Magna Carta—Britain's very first Terms and Conditions—hoping no one would scroll to clause 39.
Love oozed into Mildred's heart like microwaved brie left too long on a radiator, melting morals and hosiery alike, as Trevor (whose jawline could cut feelings and whose cologne spelled imminent compromise) approached with a bouquet of regret and supermarket roses, promising forever—by which he meant Thursday—beneath a moon blinking like a broken smoke alarm.
It was a moist and lonely evening when Claribel's heart, shaped like a microwaved croissant, sighed toward Tobias across the discount candle aisle, their souls colliding with a squeak like wet sneakers on linoleum as destiny, wearing clearance stickers and a faint musk of regret, proposed awkwardly between vanilla-scented flames.
Captain Nebula Jones realized faster-than-light love was impossible at sub-burrito temperatures as the starship Nostril-7 oozed through quantum mayonnaise, its hull screaming like a dial-up modem in a hurricane, while Mars (the red one) peeked shyly from behind Saturn's rings like a cosmic curtain, whispering, "password incorrect," to the universe's last, worst login attempt.
Like a velvet catastrophe unfurling in the mauve-breathed dusk, Desire—wearing slippers of sighs and a bathrobe of moonlight—tiptoed through my heart's chandeliered vestibule, jangling the keys of destiny on a rhinestone lanyard, while fate, perspiring perfume, buttered the night with star-margarine until even the shadows blushed themselves fainting with fragrant inevitability.
Timmy Tiddlewinks, aged seven-and-three-quarters (a vital statistic like the weight of a marshmallow on Jupiter), awoke in his bed which was also a pirate ship except during baths, to find that the sun had overslept, the moon had hiccups, and the alphabet had spilled everywhere like soup made of letters and disappointment.
It was a damp night in Gristleburg, the kind of night that sweats through a trench coat, when I, Detective Dirk Gravy, found the corpse of Mayor Puddleton reclining face-down in his own bisque, and the clues—like overcooked noodles—stuck to everything except the truth, which kept slipping through my forked intuition.
On a twilight so mauve it bruised the horizon's tender feelings, Desirette languished upon the fainting chaise of destiny, sipping sighs like tepid tea while chandeliers perspired diamonds, and the moon, that pale gossip, licked the windows with tongues of alabaster yearning that dripped into destiny's doily.
It was a moist evening of passion as Brenda's heart thudded like a microwave burrito left too long, oozing feelings that scalded her insides, while Todd's gaze—foggy yet piercing like a cracked windshield in a carwash—squeegeed her soul, smearing destiny across it in streaks of fate and lukewarm desire.
It was a dusty and morally ambiguous high noon when the sun hung over Coyote Gulch like a crusty sheriff's badge (polished only on Sundays), while tumbleweeds performed interpretive dance past the saloon where my six-shooter, being shy by nature, trembled in its holster like a colt allergic to horses.
As the moon, a lachrymose pearl drooling its melancholy mayonnaise upon the velvet-tufted heavens, sighed over the dew-damp village like a perfumed widow on a fainting couch, I felt destiny's doily-fingered hands crochet my soul into a doomsday doily of yearning, yonder, yet nearer than yesterday.
It was high noon somewhere between yesterday and next Thursday when Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit, whose mustache hung like a pair of dehydrated ferrets over a mouth that had forgotten vowels, moseyed into Dustbucket Gulch, where the tumbleweeds coughed and even the sun wore spurs that jangled with the melancholy of overcooked beans.
It was a damp Thursday that smelled like old alibis and microwaved fish, when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more coffee than justice, found the corpse of Mayor Puddington in three separate locations—his office, his campaign bus, and, somewhat redundantly, his own signature handshake.
On a nebula-dark and asteroid-stormy cycle, as the galaxy drizzled microwaves like lukewarm soup upon the pitted hull of Starship Indefatigable (whose warranty had expired in Sector 7G, a fact noted by the ship's passive-aggressive AI), Captain Zyx adjusted his existential helmet and prepared to hyper-jump into destiny's spam folder.
When Mortimer, the butcher-poet of Salisbury, found his fiancée had run off with a baker, he felt utterly kneaded, minced his words, and, in a rare steak of genius, swore he'd carve out a roll in history by loafing around the case until the crumb of evidence rose to meat him.
On a night so dark that shadows wore sunglasses and so stormy that the rain seemed to be falling up (which was odd because gravity was definitely on), Sir Nefarion the Moist, a wizard of some renown and much mildew, tiptoed into the haunted cabbage patch where destiny, doom, and a slightly used prophecy awaited, breathing garlic.
On the thirteenth gloaming of the fortnight, when the moon hung like a moldy toenail over Castle Gurglespine, Sir Crumblewort (last paladin of the mildew order) unsheathed his squeamishly damp sword to duel the whispering fog itself, which, due to budgetary constraints in the ether, materialized as an enthusiastic draft.
On the evening's velveteen eyelid, when celestial teardrops bedazzled the asphalt like rhinestoned sorrow, Desire—my fickle, perfumed porcupine—waltzed languorously through my ventricles, pirouetting across the parquet of destiny, while the moon, a bruised marshmallow of eternity, sagged upon the horizon and whispered, "Soon," with the breath of a thousand lavender-scented eulogies.
It was a dark-ish night in Neon Falls, where the streetlights sweated like guilty halos, when I, Detective Dirk Cardigan (fully licensed and emotionally adjacent), trailed a clue so subtle it screamed—an orphaned glove (left-handed, right-minded) pointing its lonely finger at everyone and no one, especially me and, by extension, justice.
It was a humid and suspicious evening; the moon hung like a broken streetlight—except when clouds misplaced it—while I, Detective Dirk Dander (licensed, embittered, lactose-intolerant), surveyed the crime scene where the victim lay double-crossed, face-down in upscale marinara, murdered to death by clues so obvious they practically confessed with alibis.
It was a bright and sticky morning in Gumdrop Grove, where the sun dribbled like warm applesauce over the nervous daisies, and little Puddlebug Pansy Pumpernickel, aged six-and-three-quarters-but-practically-seven, discovered that her teddy bear, Mr. Buttonfluff, had tragically learned to speak—and would not stop explaining sharing using pie charts.
It was a quantum midnight on Mars Station Beta-Alpha (formerly a shopping mall, now with worse parking), when the stars rebooted with a wheeze and the vacuum—damp as a dog's whisper—slopped against the domes, jostling my anti-gravity heart like a shopping cart with one squeaky neutrino wheel, fate's firmware pending an update I dared not click.
It was a moon-dripping evening, the sky a bruised plum smeared with the jam of destiny, when Clarabelle, whose eyes were twin aquariums of unshed opera, tiptoed across the cobblestones like a scandalized swan, clutching her heart—the overripe mango of it—while the wind composed odes upon her extremely misunderstood shawl.
It was a damp and ghastly twilight when Sir Glumbuckle the Unchosen (whose destiny had been mislabeled in the cosmic inventory) tiptoed into the mildew-soused castle where the moon screamed like a kettle, and the tapestry of a dragon (or possibly Aunt Morwenna) exhaled a breath so ancient it had footnotes, smelling of crypts, cabbage, and prophecy.
It was a positively cosmic evening, the sort of night when the nebulae smelled like burned toast and the galaxy's Wi‑Fi kept dropping, as Captain Zog—half-cyborg, half-mistake—steered the saucer through the mayonnaise-thick void, bravely recalibrating the flux-doohickey while his feelings updated to version 2.3 with optional heartbreak patch.
The cosmos burped like a microwaved burrito as Captain Nebula Jones, whose eyes were the color of Wi‑Fi, revved the starship's triple-hybrid quantum diesel, tearing a rift in the very fabric (poly-cotton blend) of space-time, through which destiny, smelling faintly of ozone and wet robot dog, awkwardly tumbled.
It was a moist and emotionally humid evening when Tiffany's heart, shaped like a microwaved croissant and twice as flaky, buttered itself against Brad's gaze across the laundromat, where the spin cycle of destiny (set accidentally to delicate) churned their souls into a foamy lather of passion, regret, and coupon-validating desire.
It was a damp and felonious evening when Detective Dirk Marlowe (no relation) tiptoed into the crime scene like a rhinoceros in ballet slippers, noting with eagle-eyed myopia the ketchup-red blood (probably Type O, or ranch), the victim's lifeless body breathing its last, and the whispering clues that shouted at him in a hush.
Her heart, a soggy croissant dunked too long in destiny's bitter coffee, collapsed buttery and tragic when Trevor—whose eyes were the color of definitely-blue—sauntered through the revolving door of the Poughkeepsie DMV, where love took a number, beeped rudely, and then sat down to wait forever.
On the velveteen cusp of a mauve-tinted dawn, where the sun dripped like overripe marmalade upon the trembling soufflé of the horizon, my heart—gossamer yet obese—thudded like a perfumed walrus in a cathedral of sighs, as destiny's rhinestoned fingernails scratched love notes onto the moist wallpaper of my yearning soul.
Her heart, a microwaved marshmallow stuck to the roof of destiny's mouth, melted the moment Bradlynn—half man, half cologne—sauntered into the laundromat like a thunderstorm in freshly folded khakis, and they knew (because the horoscope had said "sort of") that love would iron them flat until only the scorch marks remained.
Veronica's heart, a microwaved marshmallow left too long in Cupid's sticky Tupperware, bulged and collapsed as Bradly (one d because two would be too committed) strode into the laundromat, where socks spin like fate's tumbleweeds and our eyes, over a detergent sale sign, collided with the bruising tenderness of overripe avocados at dawn.
It was a night so black that even the moon wore sunglasses, and as the rain clattered like skeletal tambourines upon the cobblestones of Gristlewick, Sir Bartholomew the Mostly-Alive unsheathed his grandmother's cursed butter knife, feeling destiny burp in his gut while the castle's gargoyles blinked, terribly, for the very first time.
It was a muskets-and-mutton sort of morning in 1776, when the dew clung to the rebellious colonies like a clingy ex and General Washington, his wooden teeth clicking like castanets of liberty, unfurled a map so inaccurate it might as well have been a pizza menu, declaring destiny in a font only the Almighty and illiterate farmhands could read.
High noon staggered into Dead Cactus like a drunk clock, the sun holstered low and itchy, while Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit (who feared both tumbleweeds and commitment) saddled his lamentations to a horse named Lawsuit and prepared to duel the horizon, which kept blinking at him coyly through eyelashes of dust and poorly negotiated barbed wire.
It was a twilight so mauve it blushed with the embarrassment of existing, dribbling velveteen shadows over the town like a tipped goblet of whispered silk, while my heart—an overly dramatic avocado—surrendered its buttery truths to the serrated toast of fate, which crackled, popped, and sighed like a chandelier drowning in a teacup of moonlight.
It was a high noon that overslept and stumbled into the afternoon, rubbing the grit from its bloodshot sun-eyes while Sheriff Buckaroo McSpleen (whose spurs jingled like guilty consciences at a church raffle) squinted across a tumbleweed-choked horizon that stretched longer than a preacher's goodbye and twice as dry, promising justice, dust, and disappointments baked to a leathery moral.
It was a dark and stormy knight, mail full of issues and chain complaints, who reined in his horse because the reign was too wet, the air thick with thyme so he lost track of time, as I stared through the window pane in pain, sure our meet-cute at the butcher would be a cut above, butter not bitter.
It was in the velveteen hush of a moon so opulently pearled it wept mayonnaise that Geraldine's heart, a chandelier of trembling porcupine quills, swooned into the marmalade dusk, where the sighing begonias—saucy with dew and scandal—conspired with the obese night to ladle destiny, lukewarm and glittering, into her porcelain soul.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous Tuesday when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose chin could file insurance claims, tromped into the crime scene—an alley smelling like wet alibis and yesterday's noodles—where the victim lay arranged like a poorly proofread comma, except bloodier, leaving clues as subtle as brass knuckles in a soufflé, which everyone suspiciously ignored.
It was a bleaker-than-average dawn on Mars's third Tuesday, when the twin suns hit snooze on the horizon and the colony's life-support, like my ex's voicemail, choked, hiccuped, and updated its terms of service, which I accepted, blindly, as the stars bled Wi‑Fi and destiny buffered at 2%.
Twilight dribbled over the velveteen horizon like overcooked plum jam on a moth-eaten crumpet, while my heart—an alabaster hedgehog quivering in the boudoir of my ribs—penned sonnets in lemon-curd ink to the moon, whose lachrymose eyelashes blinked at me, damply, as if the entire sky had just remembered a very sad, very expensive secret.
On the night my ex, Olive Pitman, left me for that greasy spooner, I felt oil alone, so I mustard the courage to ketchup to her at the deli of fate, where our ham-fisted beef escalated, and, in a pickle, I made a mis-steak that cut me to the very core.
It was a quantum damp and asteroidly night; the nebulae perspired like microwaved marshmallows while Captain Dirk Stardash, whose jaw had more angles than a dodecahedron with trust issues, adjusted the hyperfluxion drive with a sigh that echoed through the vacuum (which, despite rumors, was totally fine with echoes) as planets queued politely for destiny like bored moons at a broken vending machine.
It was a damp and morally overcast afternoon when I, Detective Dirk Puddlemore, waded into the crime scene like a swan in galoshes, noting the chalk outline shaped suspiciously like last Tuesday, the smoking gun refusing to quit hiding behind a doughnut, and the widow's alibi dripping mascara the color of probable cause.
It was the kind of murder that made coffee nervous and doughnuts confess, for the corpse (formerly Mr. Percival T. Winkletop, insurance actuary, stamp licker, and part-time philatelist of ill-repute) lay sprawled like yesterday's laundry across the carpet of Apartment 3B, which smelled of regret, cheap lilacs, and the suspiciously enthusiastic cologne called Justice.
When Penelope first beheld Bartholomew across the damp salad bar at Costco, his eyes (two moist blueberries drowning in a bowl of destiny) skewered her heart like a kebab of yearning, and she knew, as surely as mayonnaise knows potato, that their love would be a coupon-clipped eternity of passion, perspiration, and bulk-sized forever.
As Captain Bramblethorpe Thistlewick III tightened his adventure boots—cracked like grandma's overbaked scones and twice as treacherous—the compass on his trembling chest whirled like a ferret in a blender while the map, tattooed on a banana peel by a drunk monk, promised glory, doom, and two-for-one souvenirs beyond the fog-sneezing horizon.
When Detective Al Dente reached the deli crime scene, the steaks were high, a serial killer had left cereal clues in cold blood-orange marmalade, and the victim—a seasoned chicken with thyme on its side but no time left—lay in a grate state, having made grave mis-steaks by refusing to ketchup, which, he mustard, would've mayoed things butter.
On the mourn of the mourning, when Detective Al Dente arrived to noodle the case of the cereal killer who left victims in raisin positions with bran-ded wounds, the scene was gruesomely pun-derful: a corpse in thyme, a note saying "I'm just here for the pun-ishment," and clues so tasteless they left a sour afterpun.
On the twelfth and most regrettable midnight, when the moon hung like an undercooked egg over the crenellated village of Whisper's End, I, Sir Grimsley Noodlethorpe, heir to the ancestral mildew, unsheathed my destiny (and also a squeaky sword), while undead llamas knit shadows into sweaters for our souls and the cathedral gargled bats ominously.
As the moon, a pallid pearl plopped into the velvet pudding of night, perspired its lachrymose luminance upon the town like a moist whisper embroidered in despair, Clarabelle's heart, a baroque accordion made of regretful swans, wheezed sonnets, then hiccuped destiny with the graceless elegance of a chandelier sneezing.
When Mayor Hamlett was found in the poultry aisle, beaten to a pulp and left for dead next to the kumquats, I knew this case would be no yolk, because the killer had left a note that said 'lettuce romaine silent'—and while the cops tossed the salad for clues, I mustard up courage, ketchupped on suspects, and relished revenge.
The starship Brobdingnag II groaned like a microwaved accordion as it slouched across the gluten-free void, stars flaking like cosmic dandruff from the unwashed scalp of eternity, while Captain Nebula—whose eyes were twin black holes that had forgotten long division—thumbed the hyperdrive switch marked DO NOT (seriously), because rules, like planets, were made to be accidentally exploded.
Detective Milt Gristle knew the case was closed the moment he opened it, because the corpse lying on the linoleum was whispering in a voice only he could hear (on account of his tinnitus) that murder had been done, and the clues—sweaty, ashamed, and alibi-shaped—were already trying to sneak past his mustache.
It was a crime rare and well-done, a filet of malice marinated in thyme and ill will, the victim tenderized to a pulp—beating around the butcher's block—while the suspect, a saucy character with a steak in the outcome, kept mum because he couldn't ketchup with the truth without mustard the courage.
Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his anti-gravity mustache as the starship Pumpernickel oozed through the marmalade of spacetime, whose quantum crumbs stuck to the hull like destiny, while alarms yodeled in Esperanto about a temporal casserole in Sector IKEA-7, which was, inconveniently, also where his ex-wife had parked the universe's last functional feeling.
It was a high noon so low it tripped over the horizon, spilling dust like old soup as Sheriff Buckle McGrit—whose mustache wore spurs sharper than his ethics—clanked into the Saloon of Unfinished Business, where the piano wheezed, the tumbleweed took a stool, and destiny ordered sarsaparilla with extra doom.
It was a sunburned morning on the high seas of the Gobi Desert, where my compass spun like a drunken ferret on an office chair, pointing not north but toward Destiny, which smelled faintly of wet canvas and destiny again, as I tightened my shoelaces of fate and prepared to outrun the horizon on foot, uphill, both ways.
It was a midnight marinated in the mauve jam of destiny, where moonbeams dribbled like perfumed gravy over the sighing rooftops (Paris, or perhaps Poughkeepsie—who can say), and my heart, a trembling chandelier of yearning, tinkled so loudly that even the stars shushed me with their silken, exasperated glitter.
It was a night the color of budget coffee and unpaid parking tickets, when I, Dirk Mangle, private eye and part-time toothpick model, discovered that the dame with legs like parentheses had misplaced her husband, her alibi, and, judging by the smell, at least three shrimp, all somewhere between the crime scene and my rent-controlled moral compass.
High noon slouched over the town like a drunk rattlesnake in a wool sweater, while Sheriff Cud P. Tumble's mustache threw longer shadows than the church bell, and my horse, who had trust issues and a mortgage, clipped-clopped toward destiny with spurs that jangled like overdue library fines in a dust storm.
The compass quivered like a guilty tuna in a can of nerves as Captain Buck Rumbletoe (not a real captain, but he had a hat, which is half the battle, if not two-thirds) strode into the jungle that was more of a shrubbery really, saber-first, nose-second, hunting for treasure, destiny, and perhaps a restroom, which legends whispered was guarded by mosquitoes the size of misunderstandings.
It was a dark and stormy knight whose armor squeaked like anxious cheese as he tiptoed through the garlic-scented fog of Crumplegrave, where the castle's gargoyles dribbled tears of mildew and the moon, swollen like a neglected blister, winked at me—yes, me—because destiny had double-booked our doom with a dragon and my mother.
It was a crime most fowl, I winged it to the scene only to find the victim beaten to a pulp—clearly a cereal killer—so I milked the witnesses for clues, buttering them up until the truth jammed my thoughts: the culprit had no alibi, only a baguette excuse, crummy and stale.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping mayonnaise light upon the trembling custard of the city, sighed through my window like a perfumed trombone as destiny—swaddled in velvet clichés and smelling faintly of lilacs and wet upholstery—tiptoed toward my soul in stilettos of inevitability, scattering similes like confetti over the soufflé of my quivering heart.
It was an adventurous dawn, the kind that puts its pants on two legs at a time, as Captain Bramblethorn—whose compass pointed at destiny the way a ferret points at chicken salad—hoisted a sail the color of regret and steered his creaking destiny-boat straight into the uncharted map margin labeled Here Be Smudges and Possibly Lunch.
It was a voluptuously velvet evening, the sky a bruised plum oozing nocturne syrup over the town's quivering shingles (which, being respectable, pretended not to quiver), while the moon, a languid blister of buttered pearl, winked like a widow's knuckle ring at the gossiping clouds as my heart—oh pantomiming metronome!—throbbed theatrically beneath its corset of destiny.
On the morn Bakerfield's sourdough rose against the crown, I knew trouble was afoot—heel bent, toe jammed, and souls on sale—because every roll call was a bunfight, every crumb a crummy clue, and each rye remark left me w(h)eated, needing proof before I loafed around and died kneadless.
It was a quantum and stormy night; the nebulae perspired in photonic torrents—except at occasional intervals when a capricious solar burp (for it is in Sector 12-B that our saga malfunctions) belched through the alleys of space-time, jangling the rivets of my star-tricycle and cruelly tousling the brave little LED that defied the cosmic dimmer switch.
It was a sultry afternoon when love, smelling faintly of microwaved roses and gym socks, sidled into Brenda's heart like a raccoon into a dumpster, while Chad—whose eyes were the color of printer ink just before it runs out—declared destiny via a text that autocorrect cruelly rendered "I loathe you."
Once upon a time—though not a punctual time, more of a dawdling, shoelace-untied sort of time—the sun yawned a lukewarm yawn over Tiddlywink Town (population: yes), where brave little Maisie McMuffin, aged precisely six-and-three-crumbs, prepared to rescue her imaginary goldfish from drowning in air, which is wetter than it sounds.
It was a damp and pun-gent evening when Detective Rye Loaf, a gluten for punishment, found the body of the town tart half-baked and batter-ed behind the bar, and as suspects began to roll in he kneaded answers, whisked through alibis, and realized the proof wouldn't rise because everyone was toast, crumby, and utterly buttered.
The moon, a languorous custard saucer spilled by heaven's wobbling waiter, dribbled its opaline melancholy upon the village like perfumed mayonnaise, while my heart, a brocadeed accordion of sighs and complicated destiny, wheezed rococo promises to the cobblestones, which, bashfully ablaze with nocturnal acne, blushed under the coquettish eyelashes of the scandalized streetlamps.
On the damp, destiny-scented dawn of 1215, when history's clock (a sundial with delusions of grandeur) struck Freedom-O'Clock beneath the surly clouds of Runnymede, King John—sweaty as a fear-struck ferret—unsheathed his quill like Excalibur 2.0 and signed the Magna Carta's crunchy parchment, thereby inventing civil rights, fine print, and the modern signature squiggle.
It was a midnight so pitch that even the bats wore sunglasses, and the castle (which was haunted, naturally, and also listed on the National Register of Eerie Places) sighed like a depressed accordion while Count Grimsby—half-elf, half-widower, all toenail—stirred the cauldron of destiny with a spoon that used to be his mother.
It was a night so guilty it should have needed a lawyer, and I, Dirk Mallory, P.I. (Penniless Investigator), sloshed through the alley's puddles of regret toward the corpse that wasn't dead yet, because it was only pretending, like my ex-wife's love and the mayor's toupee, which pointed accusingly at me like a balding sundial.
It was a bright and sticky morning in Gumdrop Glen, where the sun dripped like warm soup onto the giggle-grass (which giggles only when tickled by certified gigglers), and little Sprinkles the Squirrel resolved to run away forever, or at least until snack time, whichever came first.
It was a cold and starry morning on Planet Xerox-12, where the suns rose like two microwaved bagels over a landscape as barren as my ex's voicemail, and Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum mustache, pressed the Hypergo button marked 'Do Not Press,' and watched time fold like a badly laundered fitted sheet into yesterday's tomorrow.
It was a humid afternoon in Heartspoon, Nebraska, when Desiree's heart, which had been sitting on the back burner like leftover chili, finally boiled over and splattered onto the apron of destiny as she beheld Trevor, whose eyes were the exact color of a well-hydrated houseplant and whose jawline could julienne a cucumber of doubt.
It was a thyme of grate expectations, when the hero, a whiskered chef named Basil Faulty, kneaded love and dough in equal measures, rolling with the punches while his heart, battered and fried, flipped at the mere sauté of danger, for he couldn't resist a hot date, no matter how seedy the bar.
It was a storm-drainy night when I met Laverne at the waste treatment plant, and though her perfume was Eau de Toilet, I was flushed with feeling, tankful for the chance to pipe up, for in this cesspool of emotions I sewage to say, but my courage clogged, my hopes went septic, and my heart took a bowel turn.
As the moon, a lachrymose custard of pallid yearning, dribbled its melancholy mayonnaise over the quivering village, my heart—braided with despair, ambition, and a hint of lavender—throbbed like an orphaned timpani in a velvet hurricane (for I alone, though multitudinously accompanied by myself), perceived destiny's damp handshake beckoning from the perfumed abyss of Tuesday.
It was a dark and stormy void, the kind of vacuum that sucked the courage from a man like a faulty airlock slurping soup, when Captain Nebula Jones, his hair gelled with comet grease and his heart set to airplane mode, engaged the hyperquantum warpdrive, which hummed like a smug algorithm knitting time into a polyester eternity.
It was in the tepid aisle of Discount Barn, beneath the suggestive flicker of fluorescent lights (which hummed like lovesick cicadas), that Brenda first beheld Todd's mullet—waterfall of destiny, lagoon of mousse—and knew, with the clatter of a falling can of creamed corn, that her heart would BOGO forever.
It was the year 1215, or thereabouts (time was fuzzy like a moth-eaten tapestry), when King John, sweaty as a microwaved eel though microwaves were centuries away, parked his royal posterior at Runnymede to autograph, with all the enthusiasm of a cat at bath time, a parchment so historic it practically smelled like future documentaries and old-library breath.
It was a moon-soggy midnight, and the castle (perched like a startled toad on a cliff that had second thoughts about existing) exhaled such damp, ancestral sighs that even the ghosts put on sweaters, while below, the necromancer-prince rehearsed his destiny—badly—summoning a dragon of mildew and regret whose roar sounded exactly like a coffin learning to yodel.
It was a damply sinister moonrise when the castle (which was haunted unless you asked the groundskeeper, who denied everything in a suspiciously haunted voice) exhaled a sigh like a dragon with asthma, and the Chosen Farmboy—now middle-aged, lactose intolerant, and clanking with cursed amulets—felt destiny nibble his ankles with tiny eldritch teeth.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of silver despair, oozed its creamy melancholy over the suppurating skyline, while my heart, a grand piano stuffed with perfumed geese and unanswered letters, throbbed sonorously in the vestibule of destiny, where raindrops—each a tiny widow—embroidered the boulevard with sobbing sequins of time's voluptuously unlaundered hanky.
It was a moist and trembling dusk when Desire parked its dented sedan in the cul-de-sac of my heart, honking like a wounded swan while the streetlights blushed a custardy yellow, and I knew—because destiny texted me in all caps—that Trevor, with his crumpled bowtie and cinnamon dandruff, was the forever I'd temporarily settle for.
It was a moonless noon (yes, noon can be moonless, if you think about it), when the castle—whose stones perspired like anxious oysters—exhaled a draft of ancestral sighs that smelled of mildew and destiny, and from the oubliette (French for basement, probably) slithered a prophecy wearing a borrowed shadow and squeaky leather boots.
Under a moon shaped like a frightened toenail (the left big one), the castle of Gloomington exhaled shadows that smelled faintly of wet cabbage as Sir Crispin—half-elf, half-accountant, all destiny—unsheathed his squeaking sword to audit the crypt, where something ancient, unspeakable, and badly taxidermied blinked with interest, hunger, and perhaps hay fever.
After the organist was found decomposing, the choir wailed in A minor while I, the coroner, tried not to Handel the case too baroquely, though every lead Bach-fired, each suspect kept lyin', and the pastor's sermon droned on so long I almost gave up the ghost note.
Her love hit me like a wet baguette to the soul on that Tuesday of indeterminate humidity, when Clarissa, whose eyes were the exact color of Wi‑Fi connecting and whose laugh sounded like a dishwasher on rinse, promised forever, or at least until her phone battery died again, tragically, heroically, inevitably.
Detective Barnaby Sludge, whose trench coat smelled like a damp alibi left in a gym sock, squinted through the drizzle that fell like unpaid parking tickets on the city's guilty windshield, when suddenly the phone screamed a confession louder than his ex-wife at Thanksgiving—there'd been a murder, allegedly, of time itself, at the donut shop, by a jelly knife, maybe.
Veronica's heart—shaped like a heart, thumping like a washing machine on the spin cycle of destiny—collapsed into a soufflé of yearning when Brad (not his real name, but the one his cheekbones deserved) strode into the municipal gazebo, where pigeons applauded with their feet and the sunset blushed so hard it needed concealer.
It was a humid and emotionally moist evening when Clarissa's heart, shaped like a slightly bruised pear left at the back of love's refrigerator, fell head over sensible heels for Bradford, whose eyes were the color of Wi‑Fi signals and whose sighs smelled faintly of cinnamon, destiny, and leftover commitment.
The compass, spinning like a caffeinated ballerina in a blender (which was ironic, considering compasses are supposed to know things), pointed due Everywhere as Captain Bramblebeard lashed the soggy map to the mast with a shoelace of destiny, while the sea (a damp blue conspiracy) burped up thunder and yesterday's sandwiches of fate.
It was a night so guilty it would have lawyered up, bleeding neon confessions onto the rain-puddled sidewalks, when I, Dirk Mallard, private eye and part-time bonsai nurturer, discovered the corpse of Mayor Flapjack reclining beside a toppled streetlamp like a spilled secret, except louder, which I noted in my notebook labeled 'CLUES' for future hindsight.
It was a thyme of great peril when I, Basil Wryte, a sage private aye, was peppered with questions about the butchered case that had everyone in a pickle, and though I tried to lettuce romaine calm, the clues kept ketchup to me, mustard courage, and I carrot all no longer.
It was a thyme of grill and error when Detective Sir Loin, a rare breed with a tender heart, found himself in a searing affair with Barb Q., whose smoking past was shrouded in mis-steaks, and as the case got hotter he realized the serial (cereal) killer was raisin hell for the bran-new widow, but no one gave a fig.
On a morning as sunny as a flashlight in a sock drawer, little Timmy Bumblefluff (age seven and three quarters, a Libra if you must know) embarked upon the grandest quest a child has ever quested: to locate the Sock of Destiny behind the couch, where dust bunnies the size of guinea pigs roared in whispers like very polite thunder.
It was a damp and starless morning in the vacuum of Sector 12, where the Nebulon Express, smelling faintly of burnt coffee and destiny, wheezed like an elderly accordion through the glitter of dead suns, while Captain Vrax adjusted his eyebrow implants and prepared to boldly unwarp space-time the way one reluctantly unwarps a microwaved burrito.
It was a rank and gory night, and as I, a private I with a nose for scents, sniffed out the culprit in this foul (and fowl) case of battery, I realized the beat was eggscruciating: the victim had been whisked, beaten, and left to dye, a hard-boiled yoke on our city's cracked morals.
It was a crime of passionfruit, the kind that raisin'd eyebrows in this seedy currant-affair town, where our hard-boiled gumshoe had a lot at steak but no thyme, stalking a cereal killer whose wheaty motives were barley believable, leaving murder most fowl, poultry in motion, and a sole survivor who couldn't lettuce romaine calm.
Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat flapped like a wounded albatross stuck in a laundromat of destiny, surveyed the crime scene—an apartment so murdery you could taste the felony—while the widow, a suspiciously unmarried blonde, sobbed confessions of innocence in a voice as thin as soup, thick as thieves, and twice as watery.
On a bright and brooding morning, which was like night except sunnier, little Petunia Puddlesnort, age five-and-a-half going on legendary, clasped her emotionally supportive sippy cup and marched into Preschool Room B (the B stands for Bravery, or possibly Boogers), determined to tame the ferocious Alphabet—26 letters long and twice as dangerous, like spaghetti made of snakes.
It was a mauve and melodramatic dawn, wherein the sun, a bashful yolk trembling in the buttery skillet of heaven, oozed its golden melancholies over rooftops like syrupy sonnets, while my heart—an overstuffed settee of sighs—fainted repeatedly at the perfumed thunder of destiny's rhinestoned footsteps.
Clarissa's heart, a microwaved marshmallow of yearning, s'mored itself to Damian's gaze, which was like two coagulating puddles of moonlight in a parking lot, as their destinies—plus or minus tax—collided head-on like shopping carts, breeding sparks, squeaks, and a love so eternal it already felt overdue at the library of passion.
It was a bright midnight when Detective Dirk Marmalade (retired, except professionally) swaggered into the murder that lay on the carpet like a lasagna left out in the rain, noting clues—lipstick like a crime's autograph, footprints shaped like regret, and a donut glazed with alibi—while the sirens sobbed bagpipes into the city's ear.
Clarissa's heart, which had been hermetically sealed since the unfortunate fondue incident of '09, shuddered open like an elevator whose cables were woven from Cupid's shoelaces, when Bartholomew—smelling faintly of rain, regret, and a discount candle called 'Musk of Destiny'—entered the Laundromat of Fate, dropping his quarters and my standards in one clattering, spin-cycling avalanche.
It was on a Tuesday bristling with destiny (the cheap kind) that Captain Barnaby Squint adjusted his soggy mustache, consulted a compass that pointed mainly to gossip, unfolded a map drawn in yak butter, and strode toward the screaming jungle, where even the volcano seemed to cough politely before swallowing entire tour groups.
It was a humid night in Gristleburg, the kind that made trench coats perspire and alibis slip, when Detective Dirk Dabble—whose jawline could file paperwork—found the corpse of Councilman Peabody marinating in the municipal fountain like yesterday's soup, except stabby, and decided the case practically solved except for the murderer, motive, method, timeline, and clues.
The moment Trevor first beheld Clarissa across the discount candle aisle, his heart (a damp sponge left in the sink of destiny) squelched with passion, and he knew—because the fluorescent lights hummed his name like bees with diplomas—that their souls were buy-one-get-one, expiring Tuesday, forever, or until management announced a recall.
It was a wry and raisinable mourning in Punderton when Detective Crumb, who kneaded answers but loafed about, found the victim battered in the alley—his life whisked away, his prospects toast, his reputation in tatters and tarts—so I suppose, he sighed, we'll have to roll with it, because there's muffin we can do but proof it.
It was a humid and squeaky dusk, the sky perspiring like a lovestruck gym sock, when Claribel's heart (a fragile soufflé of feelings, prone to collapse at the slightest flirtatious draft) rose and fell like a malfunctioning elevator as Percival, reeking of aftershave and destiny, swaggered in, eyes twinkling like improperly wired Christmas lights.
When butcher-turned-detective Ham Hock found the city in slices, he knew someone had a bone to pick, so he tenderly steaked out the prime suspect—a ribald ribeye named Sir Loin—only to discover the case was offal, a bloody rare misteak he'd rue-cumin-ate over until thyme expired.
On the morn when the baker was found bread, his life having gone a-rye, I felt my spirits knead to rise, but my heart was toast, buttered up by false a-dough-ration and jam-packed regrets, so I rolled with the punches and whisked away any crumb of doubt, feeling batter already.
It was love at first slight, when Clarissa saw Bartholomew across the gluten-free bakery aisle and his eyes, the color of microwaved peas, collided with her heart like a shopping cart with a wobbly wheel, sending passion receipts fluttering, while Cupid, underpaid and overcaffeinated, fumbled his arrow and nailed a rotisserie chicken that still seemed to sizzle.
When Detective Hammett Rye arrived at the gluten-free crime scene, he knew the killer had left no loaf unturned: the victim was buttered up then toast, the alibi was crummy, and the witness—one Mr. Dijon—mustard the courage to ketchup, only to relish spilling beans that were, alas, re-fried.
On a night that was both quantum and regular (depending, of course, on your position in the queue for the shipboard lavatory), the starship Municipal Wisdom oozed through the velveteen vacuum like a sweaty swordfish in a tuxedo, its gravity-plated hull squeaking with destiny while Captain Brenda typed fate into the autopilot's password field: "password."
When Percival first beheld Esmeralda swanning by the sneeze guard of the Piggly Wiggly salad bar, his heart detonated like a microwaved grape, splattering destiny across the romaine of fate, and he knew, with the certainty of a horoscope printed on damp receipt paper, that their souls were coupons destined to be clipped together forever.
It was the kind of murder that left fingerprints on your soul's doorknob, mused Detective Dirk Gable, pulling his trench coat tighter like a promise that wouldn't button, while the alley's yellow tape fluttered like overcooked fettuccine, the chalk outline attempted downward dog, and every suspect's alibi alibi'd so hard it squeaked beneath the magnifying glass app on his phone.
It was a humid dawn of destiny when Thaddeus "Thud" McCracken, whose jawline could open coconuts and whose past was as murky as a snorkel left in soup, unfolded a map so ancient it sneezed dust, pointing (with unearned bravado) toward Treasure Island, which, inconveniently, kept migrating west on account of the fidgety tectonic plates.
It was a lavender-scented eternity of a moment when the moon, perspiring like a bashful chandelier, dripped its milky sighs onto the quivering cobblestones (which, like me, suffered nobly), while time itself, corseted and fainting, fluttered its lacey eyelashes at destiny's doorstep and promptly tripped over fate's doormat.
As the quantum nebula drizzled its ultraviolet dew upon the rusting moon (which, for tax reasons, orbited a different planet on weekends), Captain Nebulous X. Crumbsnort adjusted his empathy firmware, tasting the vacuum like overcooked noodles while his starship groaned like a homesick whale trapped in a USB port of destiny.
I knew the stakes were high the moment the butcher met his chopping block, a cleaver case of bad sir-loin behavior, but I wasn't born yester-meat; I mustard the courage, ketchup to the clues, and, with rare insight, well-done reasoning, and brisket pace, I ham-handedly uncovered the prime suspect: me.
On the twelfth bell of an evening soggier than a mermaid's handshake, the ancestral castle exhaled a mildewed sigh, and from its phlegmy gargoyles dribbled a prophecy—as legible as soup—foretelling that I, Percival Nightshade-Bumbershoot, heir to a cursed spoon, must marry the moon or be eaten politely by shadows with napkins.
The moon, a pallid custard ladled onto the velvet soufflé of night, wept opals through the doilied clouds as my heart, an overripe pomegranate of yearning, splattered its jeweled grievances across the parquet of destiny, while every sigh I exhaled braided itself into a brocade of fate too exquisite to breathe.
It was a day as brave as a brass doorknob when I, Captain Buckleby Thrasher, strapped on my weatherproof monocle and set sail across the savage Saharan Sea in my camel-powered submarine, pursuing a map tattooed backward on a parrot's tongue, while thunder applauded, dunes perspired, and destiny winked at me with both eyes.
Captain Nebula Jones awoke on the starship IRS Audacity to discover, with the slow dawning horror of a sunrise trapped in a jar, that time was late (again), gravity was on strike, and his android ex-wife had downloaded feelings, which, like space itself, were expanding in all the wrong directions.
It was a damp and suspicious evening, the kind that wore a trench coat over its own trench coat, when I, Detective Dirk Gristle, followed a trail of breadcrumbs—actually cigarette ash, though it tasted disappointingly different—through an alleyway so narrow the shadows had to queue, toward a corpse loudly pretending to be quiet, like a chandelier in a coal mine.
Little Timmy, whose freckles multiplied like unlicensed rabbits whenever he worried (which was always), clutched his emotionally unavailable teddy bear as the broccoli forest whispered tax codes at moonbeams, and he resolved, with the solemnity of a damp sponge, to set off on an educational adventure to find where lost socks file for lint-covered retirement.
It was a bright and stormless dawn when Barnaby Quest, whose name alone foretold excitement like a weather vane pointing at destiny, unfurled the moldy map (which smelled of adventure and perhaps of old cheese), tightened his courage like double-knotted laces, and set sail westward into the uncharted East, toward rumors, treasure, and certain uncertainties.
When Bradshaw first unholstered his smile in the produce aisle, it shot through my heart like a damp Cupid arrow rummaging for coupons, and I knew destiny, that fickle raccoon of romance, had overturned my trash can of feelings, leaving me dazzled, sticky, and forever committed to two-for-one melons.
Upon the opalescent cusp of dawn's languorous yawn, when the sun, a bashful yolk in heaven's cracked porcelain bowl, dribbled buttery hymns across the swooning rooftops, my heart, corseted in sighs and bedecked with the rhinestones of destiny, pirouetted like a dizzy chandelier in the parlor of eternity.
The year was 1066½, give or take, when Lady Mildred of Whatsitshire sashayed into the Norman Conquest like a swan into a soup, her bodice bristling with feudal obligations and a faint aroma of peat, while banners flapped like laundries of destiny and the baying serfs updated their gossip by torchlight and damp.
Amidst the velveteen hush of a moon that perspired pearls upon the trembling boulevards of my soul, Desire—swaddled in mauve sighs and buttered with destiny—tiptoed like a rhinoceros ballerina across the custard of memory, while the clock, drunk on eternity, hiccuped seconds that smelled faintly of lavender and old applause.
It was a bright and shadowy dawn when Dakota Valiant, whose jaw could have bench-pressed a narwhal, unfolded the ancient map that smelled like yesterday's soup and destiny, vowing to sail across deserts, rappel up the ocean, and outwit the sinister Cartographers' Guild before the volcano's alarm clock hit snooze and buried civilization in hot, spicy lava.
The map was tattooed on the back of a dead fish I found in a bazaar so secret even the merchants were surprised to be there, and as my compass spun like a moral compass (useless), I tightened my bootlaces like vows and strode toward destiny, which smelled suspiciously of wet rope and volcano.
On a Tuesday so moist you could butter it with a rainbow, little Puddles McGiggle, aged exactly seven-and-three-squirts, tiptoed across the guacamole-colored moor with his emotionally complex teddy bear, Sir Fluffleton the Third, to politely vanquish bedtime, taxes, and broccoli using only a kazoo, a feelings chart, and impeccable manners.
It was a muggy noon that felt like midnight had overslept, when Detective Lance Gravel, whose jaw was as square as a parking lot and twice as empty, stepped over the chalk outline that looked more like a kindergarten hopscotch, sniffed the air for clues like a truffle pig, and declared, "The victim died of death."
It was a luminous and binary night as the moons uploaded their feelings into the cloud, and Captain Vax Thunderbolt, whose cheekbones were sharp enough to hack a firewall, revved the starship's carburetors to warp infinity, which is like regular infinity but faster, to escape the creeping silence that screamed in ones, zeroes, and destiny.
On a Tuesday so squeaky clean you could eat your broccoli reflection off it, little Timmy Bumblefluff (aged seven-and-three-quarters and prone to heroism like a cat to lint) resolved—with the solemnity of a goldfish wedding—to teach his crayons manners, beginning with Yellow, who burped sunshine and didn't even say 'excuse me.'
Captain Buck Marrowbone adjusted his bravado like a poorly folded map and plunged into the jungle desert mountains of the Sargassalps, where parrots hissed in Esperanto and quicksand looked suspiciously like custard, vowing to rescue the priceless Idol of Peril from its ancient future tomb, or die trying, then reconsider, then try again.
On the night the butcher proposed, he gave me his cold cuts and said he'd meat me halfway, but I knew he was just trying to curry favor, for his heart was offal, his past a sausage of lies, and our future—well, let's not mince words—would be a grave mis-steak.
It was a sultry Tuesday when love, sweating like a cheese left on a radiator, dripped into Brenda's heart, where it sizzled beside the pilot light of her hope, which had been out for years, until Chad—whose eyes were the color of uncommitted oceans—slid past her soul like a loyalty card through a reluctant reader.
It was a dank and pun-gent evening, and as I sauntered past the mortuary deli, I felt my spirits cold-cut thin, for the case was afootlong: someone had mustard the nerve to ketchup to the victim and pepper him with baloney, leaving only a gravy clue and a wurst alibi.
It was a luminous midnight, the moon sweating pearls like a flustered oyster over the perfumed village of Dandlewick, where the wind, as indecisive as a debutante at a saloon piano, fluttered the velveteen curtains of my soul, which, like a wounded hummingbird dipped in marmalade, throbbed voluptuously for destiny's moist handshake and the buttered rapture of forbidden revelations.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; plasma drizzled like interstellar teardrops over the chrome suburbs of Beta Milwaukee, while Captain Dirk Nebulon—retired (but not really)—adjusted his gravity toupee and mused that love, like a malfunctioning airlock, sucks, especially when destiny's warp-engaged espresso machine (Model XJ-42, warranty void) began screaming in Morse about impending squishification.
The night was as innocent as a mugshot until crime, wearing a trench coat two sizes too metaphorical, slipped on the city's greasy moonlight and fell into my office, where a dame with legs like alibis that didn't quite stand up asked me to find her missing conscience, last seen shoplifting thunder from the clouds.
On the damp morning King John, perspiring like a cheese in a sack, minced toward Runnymede with the Magna Carta flapping at him like a bossy swan, while barons in chainmail and emotional baggage jingled impatiently, inventing democracy the way a blacksmith invents souffle—by hammering it until it stopped complaining.
It was love at first sight, or at least indigestion at second sniff, when Clarissa—whose heart was a doily and whose eyelashes beat like panicked moths against a chandelier of destiny—saw Barnaby across the salad bar, his croutons glistening with longing like tiny, buttered promises drowning in Thousand Island fate.
Once upon a time, in the sort of cheerful village where dandelions hold board meetings and clouds file complaints about sunshine, little Timmy (a boy, not a goat, though the difference would matter later) bravely prepared to eat his vegetables, which squeaked legal objections on the spoon like tiny green lawyers with broccoli briefcases, because destiny.
It was a chrome-scented dusk on Neptune's forgotten Tuesday, when the quantum fog came in sideways, except where it didn't (because of the moons, obviously), draping the megaslum's hologram pigeons in pixelated melancholy as Captain Vrax—half-cyborg, half-gluten-free—realized destiny had butt-dialed him again from the future with an ominous, buffering silence.
Upon the mauve-bellied horizon—plush as a fainting sofa smothered in grandmother's perfume (which is to say destiny's musk)—the sun oozed like an overripe mango bleeding tangerine sighs onto the quivering town, where my heart, a chandelier of moist crystal anxieties, tinkled bravely as a buttered gazelle in roller skates escaping the velvet paws of melancholy.
It was a damp and overcast twilight when I, Dirk Candlewick, P.I. (Paranoid Investigator), sloshed into the alley where the corpse lay like yesterday's lasagna, the clues screaming louder than the sirens then hushing, while my trench coat, heavy with rain and childhood, clung to me like an alibi, and the fingerprints, wearing mittens, refused to point a finger.
It was a darker-than-a-witch's-cupboard night when the moon, looking like a moldy toenail clipping (I mention this for those who care for precision), chewed the village church into crumbs of shadow while Sir Grimsby the Half-Immortal (quarter on his mother's side) unsheathed his shrieking sword and bravely wet himself as the cathedral gargoyles began lactating ectoplasm.
When Claribel first beheld Trevor across the discount candle aisle of Bargain Barn, his eyes smoldering like two microwaved meatballs beneath brows as bristly as abandoned toothbrushes, her heart performed a clumsy cartwheel of destiny and landed face-first, nose whistling, in a puddle of longing the exact color of over-steeped breakfast tea.
It was a sleek and beeping epoch; the cosmos yawned like a bored black hole at a staff meeting, while Captain Nebula Jones, whose jaw was chiseled from asteroid granite and whose emotions were in beta, rebooted destiny with a damp quantum screwdriver and whispered "engage-ish" to a reluctant, gluten-free warp drive.
It was a swashbuckling afternoon, the kind that smells like overcooked bravery and wet rope, when Captain Dirk Barnacle—whose jaw could anchor ships and whose courage was rumored to be gluten-free—consulted a map so ancient it had arthritis and decided, heroically, to sail inland toward the desert.
Detective Dirk Gravel, who smelled like an alibi left too long in the sun, waded into the crime scene where the victim lay as murdered as last week's leftovers, and, adjusting his trench coat that rustled like confidential lettuce, deduced—using raw gut, cold facts, and lukewarm coffee—that the killer was either a genius or someone else entirely.
It was a sweaty night in Swindle City, the kind that made the streetlights perspire and the alleys smell like old alibis, when I, Dirk Nickel—private eye, part-time notary—tripped over a corpse so fresh it still had confidence, clutching a clue so obvious it practically read me my Miranda rights in cursive.
It was a moist sunset that left the town sweating like a nervous oyster, when Bradlee-Lynn first beheld Tristessa across the dumpster behind Cup o' Love, and his heart—anxious, lactose-intolerant, yet brave—did a foxtrot with destiny while her gaze, the color of oversteeped tea, pierced him like a cupid-approved parking ticket.
On the night the city put on its sleaziest bathrobe and forgot to tie the sash, Detective Dirk Gravel (retired, but not really) stirred his coffee with a bullet he kept for sentimental reasons while the corpse in Apartment 3B, who had the decency to bleed tastefully, phoned in an alibi by smell alone.
When Sir Loin met Madame Ovary at the butchered book club, sparks flew medium-rare as he tenderly minced words and she, not to be outdone, offered a chopportunity for vealings, but their steak-and-ache romance was doomed: he couldn't pasteurize his past, and her binding issues left no room for commitment.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; the rain fell in plasma torrents—except when the ship's deflector umbrellas hiccupped—while Captain Vex Hardcastle, whose jaw could dock a shuttle, contemplated the paradox of being both the chosen one and his own grandfather after a time-loop tryst with a wormhole that wouldn't take no for an answer.
It was a moist and tempestuous afternoon in my heart when Bartholomew tiptoed into the cafeteria of destiny, his hair the color of oversteeped chamomile and his eyes two soggy emerald croutons bobbing in the tepid soup of his face, and I, Clarabelle, fell instantly upward, sideways, and fiscally into something people with dictionaries call love.
It was a quantum and stormy night, the nebular rain falling in gluon torrents except when interrupted by the occasional hyperspace burp that jostled the star-scrapers of Neo-London (for it is in Sector 12 we loiter), petting the plasma lamps that meowed weakly against the vacuum of inevitability.
It was a dark and stormy nebula, the kind that rained plasma like lukewarm soup across the rickety hull of the Starship Unnecessary (registry number TBD), as Captain Vance Quasar adjusted his quantum monocle and sighed heroically, because destiny, like a wormhole with low self-esteem, simply refused to stop opening in inconvenient places.
It was a dry and dusty dawn in Deadpan Gulch, where the sun rose like a fried egg dropped in gravel and Sheriff Cactus McGrit (so named for his disposition, his hat, and three unrelated reasons) hitched his morality to a squeaky tumbleweed and spurred it toward justice, which whinnied.
It was a dusk like a velvet bruise smeared across the sky, sighing perfumes of melancholy and lukewarm destiny, as the moon, that pale carbuncle of heaven, perspired pearls upon the city's eyelids while my heart—an overcooked soufflé of yearning—collapsed with a whimpering grandeur into the porcelain saucer of fate.
When Delilah swiveled into the laundromat, the automatic doors sighed like two exhausted lovers and my heart, already pre-shrunk by life's rinse cycle, expanded three sizes, threatening to overboil like a microwaved egg, for her eyes were azure puddles of destiny where ducks of fate paddled noisily, honking my name in passionate, ill-tuned unison.
It was a night that slunk like a crooked cat down the soggy alley of time (for it is in our city of Brickton that our drama skulks), pawing at fate's puddles, when Detective Dirk Gravel—hard as a soft-boiled egg and twice as runny—solved the missing-evidence case because the clues didn't add up, which is why they multiplied.
On the dark and stormy brunch when Detective Hammett began his stake—sorry, steak—out at the deli of iniquity, he knew this was no mere cereal killer but a seasoned offender with no thyme to lose, whose sole purpose was to make mincemeat of lard and order, then lettuce romaine calm while the gouda times rolled.
Detective Nick Gravel, whose trench coat clung to him like a damp accusation and whose mustache resembled a crime scene in progress, knew the case was fishy when the alibi smelled like tuna melt and the corpse, not to put too fine a point on it, was alive only in the past.
The moon, a lachrymose lemon loitering in the boudoir of the heavens, dribbled its buttery sorrow upon the town's somnolent shingles, where lovers, accountants, and incontinent cats sighed in polyphonic agony, while destiny—moist, velvet, and slightly cross-eyed—tiptoed in high heels across my quivering soul like a rhinoceros in taffeta.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; plasma rain tittered against the starship's windshield (which was not a windshield at all but a photonic deflector, though try telling that to the warranty), as Captain Vrax—half-cyborg, half-divorcé—brooded about destiny, coffee, and the soft reboot of reality scheduled for 0900 Galactic Mean.
High noon sprawled unevenly across Coyote Junction like an egg yolk on a rusty skillet, while the tumbleweeds procrastinated, the saloon doors flapped like indecisive pancakes, and Sheriff Buck Gristle, whose eyes were spurs and whose horse had opinions, unholstered destiny, which coughed politely and misfired into yesterday.
It was a humid night in a city wearing its guilt like a thrift-store tuxedo, and as my trench coat collected rain the way the morgue collects promises, the victim lay alphabetized under a sheet, the suspect's alibi drooped like overcooked spaghetti, the gun smoked like a disappointed uncle, and the footprints tap-danced backward into darkness.
Like a chandelier sobbing crystal tears into the velvet abyss of destiny's boudoir, my heart—nay, the universe's perfumed ventricles—throbbed with baroque inevitability, while the moon, a custard pie of celestial yearning, slumped against the sky's fainting couch as if to whisper that love, that gaudy tyrant, had misplaced its opera gloves again.
It was a moist night, the kind that made my trench coat cling like needy lasagna, when the corpse of Councilman Crumblewitt lay sprawled across his own affidavit, bleeding punctuation onto the parquet, and I, Detective Dirk Dullard, sniffed the air for clues as if they were coupons, expired yet somehow incriminating, in destiny's garbage disposal.
It was a quantumly foggy sunrise on Proxima Suburbia, where the twin suns blinked like tired smoke alarms and the starship Esperanto idled at the curb with its left blinker eternally on, while Captain Neva Nebula adjusted her anti-gravity girdle and prepared to boldly misinterpret the Prime Directive with a coupon.
It was a dark and stormy nebula, the kind that fries an astronaut's hairnet with static like a cat in a microwave, when Captain Zaxx Quantum—whose chin had its own gravity well—revved the starship's osscilithic hyper-wishbone to eleven, thereby time-paradoxing his ex-mother-in-law into becoming his future ship's slightly damp AI.
Love hit Horace like a damp baguette flung by destiny's lunch lady, splatting against the cafeteria of his heart; and Miranda (who was basically a swan wearing yoga pants) fluttered into his soul's lost-and-found bin, where his feelings, sticky as week-old soda and twice as fizzy, bubbled up to propose with a ring-shaped onion.
I knew destiny was knocking like a debt collector with brass knuckles when my compass spun like a drunken ballerina on a merry-go-round of doom and the map, tattooed on the back of a ferret I'd won in a bar fight, shivered, promising treasures so unspeakably ancient they smelled like yesterday's oatmeal.
She knew love had finally frappéed her heart like a barista with a vendetta when Bradly, whose eyes were the color of a wet teal SUV, whispered "bonjourno" in an accent that sounded like a saxophone drowning in soup, and destiny, wearing flip-flops, slipped on their sizzling chemistry and sued.
Veronica's heart, a soggy croissant left out in the rain (Paris, but emotionally), flaked apart as Brad—whose eyes were the exact color of a hospital waiting room wall—strode toward her with the muscular inevitability of a tax audit, whispering "bonjourno" while their souls high-fived meaningfully beneath a sunset the hue of ketchup bravely pretending to be bloodshed.
When Detective Thaddeus Gutt, a lactose-intolerant cop with a gut feeling for dairy crimes, arrived at the scene of the grated murder, he knew the case would be a whey of life and death: the victim, a curd-stomer named BrieAnna, had clearly met her bleu-tiful end, knife and all, gouda grief.
Detective Dirk Mackerel, a cigarette dangling like an afterthought from lips chapped with justice, sloshed through rain that fell like evidence (wet, incriminating, everywhere), following the chalky outline of a clue only he could see—namely, a footprint shaped suspiciously like a motive—straight to the culprit's alibi, which was bleeding honesty all over the carpet.
It was a quantum midnight on the starship Municipal Ordinance (Registry #404, currently not found), where time dripped from the ceiling in nanoseconds and Captain Brenda Nebula—whose eyes were like twin event horizons sucking compliments—ordered the hyperspoon to warp-stir reality, which clumped like reheated spacetime oatmeal against the hull's feelings, or perhaps mine.
Detective Dirk Mallory, whose trench coat flapped like a wounded albatross caught in a laundromat ceiling fan, surveyed the crime scene—a corpse lounging on the linoleum like a tired question mark—while the city's sirens wept, the donuts went stale, and every clue hid itself behind an alibi as thin as hospital coffee.
It was a damp and starry night on Planet Beige, where the moons hung like overripe marshmallows and the AI Overmother hummed lullabies in binary to my laser-spoon, as I, Captain Vortex McNebula, adjusted the warp-flux-ether-drive with a heroic sigh that echoed in the vacuum, somehow, while the constellations filed noise complaints.
It was a dark and drizzly crime o'clock when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more coffee than daylight and vice versa, sauntered into the victimless murder scene—except for the victim—sniffing clues like a sommelier of injustice while the neon confessed to the rain and the alibi looked guilty in italics, bold, and underline.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous evening when I, Dirk Mallory, private eye and reluctant lactose intolerant, followed the trail of clues like bread crumbs dropped by a gluten-free Hansel through alleys slicker than eel pajamas, until the corpse, which had the decency to be dead, stared up at me with accusatory taxidermy eyes.
It was a night so dark the moon filed a missing sun complaint, and as the drizzle scuttled like damp beetles down the buttresses of Castle Gloomington, young Sir Bramblewort unsheathed his grandmother's sentient pickle-fork, whose whispered prophecies (mostly about mildew) foretold that the apocalypse would smell faintly of lavender and soup.
Detective Ambrose Crumple, whose trench coat clung like a remorseful limpet to a barnacled memory of the academy, stepped into the alley where the corpse (formerly a taxpayer, allegedly) lounged in chalk, while the rain—interrogative as a mother-in-law and twice as damp—beat confessions from the dumpsters and the neon fizzed like a cheap alibi.
It was the kind of soggy midnight that made the city smell like a ham sandwich left in a glove compartment, when I, Detective Dirk Drizzle, stalked the mean sidewalks in my creaking trench coat, sniffing for clues like a bloodhound with hay fever, until a scream shattered the fog like a cheap vase, again.
It was love at first sight, second glance, and third nostril flare when Brenda, whose heart was a damp croissant in the bakery of destiny, locked eyes with Trevor across the parking lot of the Discount Spleen-Mart, where fate, like a malfunctioning shopping cart, veered squeakily toward forever.
It was a night whose velvet darkness dripped like overripe plums onto the cobblestones of destiny, where moonbeams preened themselves in puddles like narcissistic swans and my heart, a trembling chandelier of emotions, tinkled its crystallized despair while the wind, perfumed with damp nostalgia, caressed the city's peeling eyelids with language too exquisite for breathing.
On the night the baker was found beaten, the town rose to the occasion like a yeast of burden, for while the stakes were high and the steaks were overdone at the fundraiser, I kneaded answers, whisked away clues, and tried not to crumble under the glutenous pressure of a crumby case.
When Inspector Claude Smarmy arrived at the crime scene—a deli where the ham had been murdered in cold cuts—he mustard his courage, tried to relish the clues, and mayo-vered the details while the prime suspect, a sourdough named Rye-an, insisted he'd been framed, but the alibi was crummy, the motive was cheesy, and frankly it was hard to ketchup.
It was the sort of murder that tiptoes loudly through a neighborhood (the good part, with the bad apples), leaving a chalk outline shaped like a question mark and a smell like wet alibis, and I, Detective Dirk Gravel, chewed my last cigarette thoughtfully as clues rained uphill into my trench coat.
It was a moist and apprehensive twilight in the kingdom of Gloamshire when the moon, pale as unbuttered toast left under a bed, peeked through ragged thunderclouds to witness Sir Puddlebones unsheathe his destiny (which squeaked), while somewhere below the castle the necromancer's dragon sneezed souls like glitter into the mildew-smelling yawns of eternity.
It was a night so guilty the moon pled the Fifth, while rain testified in damp sobs against the city (a metropolis with alleys narrow as alibis and morals as crooked as a cop's smile), and I, Detective Dirk Doldrum, lit a cigarette that smoked like a gun still thinking about what it had done.
History, that crusty bread loaf of yesterday (left on the windowsill of destiny), went stale the moment young Percival quilled his signature onto the Magna Carta 2.0 in a drizzle so British it apologized, while trebuchets bleated like melancholic goats and the peasants tweeted rumors onto parchment about a comet shaped exactly like Henry VIII's regretful left shoe.
On the thirteenth midnight of Bleakember, when the moon hung like a curdled eyeball in the soup-bowl sky, Sir Grimsby Nightflannel unsheathed his ancestral teaspoon of destiny to stir the yawning abyss, from which exhaled a draft so chilly it gave the cobwebs goosebumps and taught the shadows to scream politely.
It was a dank and storied knight—Sir Loin, a cut above the rest until he met his grisly end at the butcher's block party, where the stakes were high, the spirits barley restrained, and every witness had an a-grain-de motive, though the case will be for naught but offal conclusions and missed steaks.
It was a sparkly and educational morning when Little Timmy, age unspecified but marketable, clutched his feelings (which were sticky like jam and twice as instructive) and tiptoed down the hallway of destiny past Mommy's laundry mountain, where socks, like shy dragons, yearned to be paired, as, frankly, don't we all.
Moonbeams dribbled like lukewarm custard over the expectant rooftops as Veronica, a symphony of sighs wrapped in mauve velour, perambulated the cobblestones with the tentative ferocity of a butter knife, each heartbeat a chandelier crash echoing through the cathedral of her spleen where destiny, sequined and moist, rehearsed its damp soliloquy.
On the evening the moon hung over Puddlewick like a pale toenail clipping, Desiree felt her heart inflate like a microwaved marshmallow (sticky, puffed, and faintly explosive) for Trevor, whose gaze—rosy as a overcooked salmon and twice as moist—pierced her soul in the supermarket's scented-candle aisle, where passion, coupons, and cinnamon-scented destiny commingled fragrantly yet hazardously.
It was a bright and naptime afternoon, the sun dribbling like warm applesauce across the playground (which is where our hero, Timmy, age 7¾, was), while the swings squeaked like scared mice with manners and the clouds spelled HELLO in toddler font, as destiny toddled over, sticky-fingered, to pat him on his safety-approved helmet.
It was a bleak and binary night on Planet Xerox-9, where the moons blinked like low-battery icons and the wind smelled suspiciously of warmed circuitry, as Captain Nebula Flexbody, whose chin had its own orbit, downloaded his destiny from a sulking nebula while time itself tripped over a USB cable and spilled eternity onto his boots.
Clutching the map that looked like a stale tortilla someone had sneezed secrets onto, Captain Bolder Dash (so-called by himself) hacked at the jungle—which was really more of an aggressively green rumor—with a rusty hope-machete, while his compass spun like a disco weathervane pointing bravely toward Everywhere, except, inconveniently, the treasure he loudly deserved.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; ions rained sideways like sarcastic bees as Captain Nebula, brooding hero of the Starship Subjunctive, set phasers to "perhaps" and listened to the universe buffer, while the quantum toaster decloaked to butter spacetime with antimatter jam and regret.
It was a humid afternoon when love, like a microwaved lasagna left in the breakroom too long, oozed between Brenda and Chad, its cheese-string destiny stretching painfully across the cubicle abyss as the copier wheezed and the HR poster stared, reminding them that fraternization was prohibited but fate forgot to initial the policy.
It was a moist and throbbing evening when Desiree met Lance-a-Lot at the discount candle emporium, and as their eyes collided like two shopping carts in the romance aisle, her heart did a sloppy cartwheel into his soul's lukewarm soup, which he stirred with a wink that smelled faintly of cinnamon and destiny.
It was a heroic morning that smelled like wet leather and destiny, when Captain Buck Thunderclap (retired—though not from danger, mind you) adjusted his eyebrow-wide compass, unfurled his map made of suspiciously fresh parchment, and vowed to discover the Unfound Foundry of Fortune before lunch or indigestion, whichever attacked first.
Like a moon-sick swan drowning in velvet custard, my heart, a chandelier of trembling teardrops, tinkled its crystalline confessions into the alabaster night, while destiny—perfumed with the musky sighs of forgotten cupcakes—tiptoed through the bougainvillea of my soul, plucking petal-echoes that sobbed with the buttery thunder of eternal maybe.
The moon, a pallid custard spilled by trembling angels upon the quivering soufflé of the sky, dripped its lachrymose butter over the town's sighing shingles, while my heart, a baroque chandelier of yearning and dandruff, tinkled despairingly at destiny's doorbell, which, rusted with fate, squealed like a sonnet stuffed into a teapot.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; ionized rains fell in torrents—except at occasional warp intervals, when a petulant solar hiccup inverted the gravity like a seasick elevator and swept up the space-lanes (for it is in Quadrant Fred where our saga reclines), pinging off chrome meteor-tenements and agitating the flickery hologas lamps that bravely blinked against the vacuumed gloom.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous evening when I, Detective Dirk Gravel (licensed, though the license was in my other trench coat), discovered the corpse of Mrs. Petunia Crumplebottom lying horizontally on the floor in a very dead way, the only clue being a whispery odor of guilt, a smeared lipstick, and twelve suspiciously innocent alibis.
It was a humid dusk so sweaty it needed deodorant when Captain Buck Swagger, holding a treasure map drawn in ketchup on a napkin he found under a yak in Albuquerque, set sail on his desert schooner toward the uncharted Jungle of Ice, where destiny waited, tapping its foot impatiently like a bored walrus.
On a dark and stormy knight, Sir Loin of Beefwell raised the stakes to a rare degree, carving through the gristle of fate with his sidekick Marinara, while the ham-fisted bard Cole Slawtaire tossed such dressing couplets that the lettuce pray-ers turned over a new leaf and the plot thickened like cold gravy.
It was a night as purple as a bruise on the universe's overripe plum, swollen with moonjuice and melodrama, while the winds, perfumed like a widow's sigh steeped in lavender regret, tangoed with the treacherously coquettish curtains, and my heart, a chandelier of delicate porcupines, shivered itself into glitter, illuminating truths too shimmering to be believed by ordinary eyeballs.
On a morning so sunny that the sun itself wore sunglasses (but tiny ones, because it was considerate), little Prunella Puddleskip, whose socks were matched only in spirit, embarked upon a grand adventure to the Pantry of Peril, where the milk expired yesterday and the cereal snapped, crackled, and filed complaints.
It was a high-noon so low it scraped its chaps on the horizon as Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit, whose mustache had seen more sunsets than the calendar allowed, clanked into the Saloon O' Regret, where the piano wheezed like an asthmatic cactus and destiny ordered beans, hold the mercy.
It was a night so guilty it would have pleaded the Fifth, fog fingerprinting the lampposts while rain performed a sloppy stakeout on the sidewalk, when I, Detective Dirk Dirksen, whose eyes were blue like a warrant, discovered the corpse of Mayor McMuffin, alive and breathing suspiciously, which was my first clue something was dead wrong.
It was a sultry Tuesday of the heart, when the moon, queasy from overexposure, slid like a damp noodle across the buttered sky, and Desire—wearing discount perfume and a cardigan of longing—tripped over its own shoelaces and fell face-first into Trevor, whose eyes were two lukewarm cappuccinos with commitment issues.
Timmy Tiddlewink, age seven and three-quarters if you must know, clutched his ethically sourced glitter as the sun yawned awake like a lazy lemon pancake on a sky-griddle, while Mommy's inspirational hashtag whispers (TM) tiptoed into his ears, promising that today, finally, vegetables would taste like victory and possibly dolphins.
It was a humid sigh of an evening when Clarissa's heart, shaped like a microwaveable lasagna (family size), pinged for Bartholomew, whose eyes were the color of uncommitted oceans and twice as shallow, as they met beside the dumpster behind Cupid's Buffet and felt destiny (or indigestion) twine them like cheap earbuds in a pocket of fate.
It was on a moon that looked like a peeled grape drooling silver juice onto the crenelated cornfields that Sir Bramblewick, paladin of the Damp, tiptoed into the crypt—where the air smelled like yesterday's soup and grandmother's closet—only to find the prophecy scrawled in toenail clippings, blinking, and politely asking who had brought the salad tongs.
On a midnight wetter than a mermaid's handshake and twice as fishy, Baroness Gloomwaddle tiptoed through the cobwebbed mausoleum of her feelings, clutching a squealing prophecy like a damp baguette, while moonlight, pale as vampire dandruff, dripped from the gargoyles and into the yawning mouth of destiny's laundry chute.
It was the year 1066—give or take a decade, calendars being wobbly then—when Lady Griselda, whose bosom was as fortified as a Norman keep (and twice as drafty), strode across the moat of destiny in squeaky hose and regret, her heart downloading sorrow like a falcon app while the tapestry of fate buffered in the draughty hall.
It was the sort of morning that dawned only in the annals of destiny, when the cobblestones of 1793 Paris shivered like porridge skin beneath the guillotine's shadow (which, being a shadow, was famously light), and young Étienne, whose ancestors included both Romans and a rumor, adjusted his heroic wig and resolved to revolutionize breakfast.
The map unfurled like a greasy omelet across Captain Danderly's trembling knees as the volcano sneezed hot pebbles and the jungle belched suspicious aromas, promising treasure so glittery it could blind a narwhal, if narwhals had eyes for gold, which they probably do, according to Aunt Petunia's unreliable maritime scrapbook.
It was a dark and stormy knight who, having lost his bearings, took a left intestine at the fork in the road, which gut him thinking that life is offal, and as he tripe-d warily past the butcher's, he resolved to meat his destiny head-on, come what mayhem or spare ribs.
It was a sweaty dawn of destiny when Barnaby Quill, whose chin (for reasons best left to cartographers) pointed north-northwest, unfurled the moldy map that smelled of thunder and grandmother soup, and set forth—boots heroically waterproof—toward the jungle (or was it a marina?) where treasure, romance, and paperwork awaited like impatient volcanoes.
Night oozed like squid ink over the castle of Grimblewretch as Baroness Euphemia, last of the broccoli-haired bloodline, adjusted the cursed tiara that screamed in Latin when scratched, while a dragon belched gluten-free brimstone and the undead butler—who smelled like library paste and promises—shuffled nearer with a tray of twitching teacakes.
It was the kind of opalescent twilight that draped itself like a velvet octopus over the village of Crumblewick, each streetlamp exhaling buttery sighs while the cobblestones, slick as buttered eels, remembered my name in italics, and my heart, that extravagant chandelier of meat, tinkled with the crystal teardrops of destiny's overwatered potplant.
Our love blossomed like a microwaved burrito at precisely 3:17 a.m.—steaming, sloppy, and redolent of destiny—when Trevor (whose eyes were the exact disconcerting green of a weather app's severe thunderstorm warning) spilled tepid chamomile onto my lap, baptizing my corduroy heart with a dampness neither of us dared call fate.
It was a bright and treacherous dawn when Captain Bucklethorpe Thistlewhack, whose jaw could chisel cheddar, set forth across the murmuring desert sea with only a squeaky leather satchel, a compass that pointed mostly at itself, and a map inked on a banana peel that had seen better smoothies, in pursuit of the fabled Cliff of Bottomless Summits.
It was a night so guilty it would have pled the Fifth, the moon wearing a ski mask while the fog fingered the alley like a lineup, and I, Detective Dirk Dirksen, followed the clues—two footprints, a lipstick, and a tuna sandwich alibi—into a labyrinthine cul-de-sac of treachery and parking violations.
Detective Dirk Malloy knew the case was fishier than a tuna casserole left in a sauna when the victim, a billionaire philatelist with enemies stacked like junk mail, was found deceased yet somehow breathing lies, his alibi as holey as Swiss cheese in a church, while rain interrogated the city with cold, wet knuckles.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat clung to him like a damp alibi at a pool party, squinted through the foggy neon of Gristle City as the corpse on Pier 12 lay there breathing its last dead breath, whispering clues only my ears could ignore while the rain committed perjury on the sidewalks.
It was a damp and possibly illegal evening when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more noodles than bullets (long story, don't ask), stalked the alley like a confused panther with bunions, sniffing the clues—mostly anchovies and regret—toward a corpse that stubbornly refused to identify itself.
On the eve of the French Revolution (for it is Paris where our plot is croissant-shaped), when baguettes were harder than hearts and powdered wigs snowed like dandruff upon the boulevards, Jean-Pierre—blacksmith, philosopher, and part-time mime—felt destiny's guillotine tickle his neck like a flirtatious butter knife, while Marie-Antoinette updated her status: let them eat vibes.
Her heart, a microwaved croissant of longing, laminated with buttery layers of regret and hope (mostly store-brand), rose in the toaster-oven of destiny when Chadwick—whose eyes were the color of that part of the ocean where hotel pools pretend to be—sauntered in, carrying roses, allergies, and the faint aroma of future arguments.
It was love at first collision when Bartholomew rear-ended Clarissa in the parking lot of Cupid's Big-Box Emporium, and his heart, slick as a buttered otter, somersaulted through his ribs while her perfume—like rain on microwaved lasagna—told him destiny had DM'd them both with a glittery, nonrefundable forever.
It was a moist and destiny-scented Tuesday when Clarabelle's heart, which had been hermetically sealed since 2009 like a leftover lasagna, exploded into confetti at the sight of Bartholomew's eyebrows—two ravenous caterpillars tangoing above a nose as noble as a cruise ship—while fate, wearing squeaky rubber gloves, prepared to perform open-chest love on them both.
As the powdered dawn of 1776 broke like a dropped meringue upon the cobblestones of Philadelphia, young Abigail-Not-That-One adjusted her corset of destiny (tight as Parliament's purse strings), updated her quill to the latest firmware, and resolved to text liberty—by which she meant marry it—before the tea got lukewarm again.
It was a moist, morally ambiguous evening when Detective Dirk Gravel—whose chin could file affidavits and whose trench coat smelled like subpoenas left in soup—stalked the crime scene (a deli of dubious meats), reading clues like limp lettuce, while the corpse, inconveniently alive with alibis, lay there screaming silently that the salami had been framed.
It was a gloomier-than-thou midnight in the kingdom of Goryshire, where the moons (there were three, one sulking) wept mayonnaise-thick fog over the crenellations, and I, Sir Barnaby Bramble, novice necromancer and part-time cobbler, heard the castle's wallpaper whisper my true name, which, disappointingly, sounded like a wet boot being removed.
It was a dry and dusty noon in Deadpan Gulch when the sun, a runny yolk smashed on the skillet of the heavens, drooled down my eyeballs, the saloon doors (shyer than two gossiping widows at a barn dance) flapped hello to my jangling spurs, the cacti saluted like unshaven sheriffs, and my horse, Tax Credit, neighed something about destiny.
Once upon a time in the cul-de-sac kingdom of Gumdropshire, little Timmy Tiptoe, whose freckles formed the Big Dipper if the stars were sticky raisins and late for bedtime, mounted his squeaky tricycle steed to retrieve the Lost Sock of Destiny from the Dryer Dragon, whose roar sounded like a grandpa sneezing into a tuba.
In the velveteen vacuum of Quadrant XXIII, where stars blinked like elderly routers and time sagged like taffy forgotten under a neutron sun, Captain Nebula Quasar (whose jaw could dock a shuttle) flipped the warp-on switch, hearing the universe clear its throat as reality rebooted, updated, and fatally blue-screened.
It was a moist and perspiring dusk, and Delilah's heart, a microwaved marshmallow in a cardigan, slumped and sizzled as Chadwick's cologne—notes of axle grease, pine-scented ambition, and regret—wafted toward her like destiny's elevator air freshener, fogging her soul-windows as their eyes collided in a slow-motion pileup of forever.
It was a damp and suspicious evening when Detective Dirk Dander, whose mustache had interrogated more suspects than Internal Affairs ever could, waded through a puddle the size of his alimony payments toward a corpse that wasn't exactly dead yet but was thinking about it, as the streetlight flickered Morse code that spelled "murder" in lowercase.
It was a high noon so low it scraped its knees on the horizon, and the sun fried the town of Lintbucket (territory disputed mainly by goats) like a biscuit left in Hell's Dutch oven, while tumbleweeds staggered drunkenly, spurs jingled like nervous cutlery, and Sheriff Percival "Pinecone" Drab uncocked his cocked six-shooter to look busy.
As the sun rose like a bruised grapefruit over the yawning mouth of the jungle that definitely had teeth, Captain Dirk Thunderpants adjusted his screaming compass, unfolded his soggy map (tattooed backwards on a questionable mole), and vowed to retrieve the Lost Emerald of Oblivion—or die trying, but preferably after lunch, weather permitting.
It was a moist and cloying twilight when Bradlynn (half barista, half poet, all man) entered my heart like a buy-one-get-one coupon crumpled at the bottom of destiny's purse, and I knew our love would be forever—pending approval—because his eyes, two lukewarm cappuccinos, blinked crema at my soul.
It was a moist and confusing twilight when Beatrice, whose heart was a thrift-store snow globe of emotions, first beheld Lance atop the escalator of destiny at the Mall of Eternal Bargains, their eyes colliding like shopping carts, sparks flying, alarms blaring, and love, that sloppy glue gun of fate, stringing hot webby strands between their trembling, coupon-clipped souls.
On the Tuesday that destiny tripped over its own shoelaces and fell headlong into my heart like a sack of overripe avocados dropped from a helicopter, I beheld Bradwardine—half man, half cardigan, all smolder—whose eyes, two microwaves set to defrost, melted my resolve into a puddle of yearning shaped suspiciously like Nebraska.
On the night I met Rosemary, the thyme was ripe, the stakes were rare, and I, a seasoned private eye with a peppered past and a salt-and-batteried heart, knew I was in for a grilling, because every clue was a butchered cut-up and the case—oh, spare me—had already gone to wurst.
When Trevor first beheld Bernadette across the discount candle aisle, her eyes smoldering like two undercooked crème brûlées beneath brows as perplexed as his heart, destiny hit him like a mislabeled shopping cart, and he knew, with a certainty that smelled faintly of lilac and regret, that their souls were BOGO and nonrefundable.
It was love at first sniff, when Clarissa inhaled the humid bouquet of Percival's cologne — a reckless collision of sandalwood, regret, and something like microwaved cinnamon buns — and felt her heart do the hokey-pokey inside its ribcage as destiny, wearing damp socks, tiptoed across the linoleum of her lonely soul.
It was a moist and suspicious evening when Detective Lance Gravel, whose jaw was chiseled from leftover quarry stones of justice, sniffed the crime scene like a sommelier of despair, noting how the corpse lay casually on the carpet like a thrown scarf of mortality, while the streetlights winked alibis in Morse code to nobody.
It was a dark and stormy knight, armor-plated with dread as baron weather turned pun-gent, and I mustard the courage to ketchup with my past, lettuce romaine calm while the stakes, though rare, were well done, for time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like a banana split our a-peel-ing family apart, which, frank, was the wurst.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; the rain, being plasma, fell upward in deferential spirals while Captain Vax Hyperion—whose cheekbones had been sharpened by relativistic speeds—brooded on the bridge of the USS Existential Dreadnought, where the ship's AI, named M.O.M., nagged the universe into a wormhole like a stubborn spaghetti noodle.
It was high noon, or maybe low, the sun dangling like a lopsided spittoon over Cactus Gulch, where Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit (whose mustache wore him, not the other way around) holstered his suspicions beside his hipbones and squinted heroically at the horizon that refused to blink, while tumbleweeds tiptoed by like guilty buffalo in ballerina shoes.
Once upon a time, which is not to say now but could be if you try very hard and eat your peas, little Timmy Tiddlewink—whose ears stuck out like parentheses embracing a head full of questions and possibly raisins—embarked on an adventure so safe, supervised, and educational that even the clouds filled out permission slips before drifting anywhere.
It was a bright and stormless afternoon when Dirk Throttle, moustache bristling like two disgruntled caterpillars late for a funeral, unfurled a map so ancient it sneezed dust (or perhaps I did), vowed to discover the Lost Peninsula of Somewhere, and heroically tripped over destiny—also known as his own shoelaces—into the yawning jungle's lobby.
The moon, a lachrymose lemon lozenge lollygagging in the boudoir-blue bouillabaisse of the heavens, wept its silvery mayonnaise onto the quivering boulevard (which, I assure you, had recently taken a correspondence course in melancholy), while my heart—an overripe cantaloupe in corsetry—throbbed like a fainting sofa kissing a sneeze.
It was a night so guilty it would have pleaded the Fifth, and I, Detective Dirk Malarkey, sloshed through alleyway shadows like cold coffee in a chipped mug, following a trail of clues lazier than a Sunday donut, until the corpse—looking surprised in a way only the truly dead or newly married manage—stared at me accusingly with both eyes closed.
In the neon-lit vacuum of Sector 9, where time dribbled like lukewarm gravy onto the chrome tablecloth of destiny, Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum feelings and punched the hyperdrive with a fistful of starlight, causing reality to sneeze politely and eject Tuesday into a disappointed wormhole.
The moon, a languishing custard of celestial despair, dribbled its melancholy mayonnaise across the trembling rooftops as my heart, a fainting armadillo in a corset of sighs, pirouetted through the chiffon miasma of destiny, while the clock hiccuped midnight like a besotted uncle and destiny's chandelier sneezed sequins onto the expectant, perspiring horizon.
It was not merely a night but a velvet nocturne hemorrhaging moon-milk upon the lachrymose cobblestones, where my heart—an overstuffed fainting couch upholstered in sighs—reclined beneath the chandelier of the heavens, tinkling with teardrop stars, as destiny, perfumed like wilting lilacs and damp laundry, tiptoed toward me in tap shoes of thunderous inevitability.
It was a damp alibi of a night, the kind that left fingerprints on your soul, when Detective Dirk Mulligan, whose trench coat smelled like unresolved cases and egg salad, realized the corpse was not only dead but inconsiderately so, lying there like a spilled secret in italics, underlining nothing but everyone's guilt.
When deli detective Ham-ish McCobb heard the case was cold cuts, he mustard the intestine fortitude, mayo prayer, and let it sink in his gut—this was no baloney; the killer had a chip on his shoulder, a sour streak a mile wide, and an offal past that would curdle the eyes and ketchup with him.
It was on the cusp of dawn at precisely midnight when Captain Bartholomew "Thunderpants" McGrit, whose chin had its own weather, unfurled his moth-nibbled map of the Uncharted Charted Isles, sniffed the horizon for clues, and vowed to rescue the priceless Sapphire of Tomorrow from yesterday's volcano before lunch.
It was a grime scene in thyme, the currant of events raisin eyebrows as the loafing detective (a crusty old soul with buns of steel) kneaded answers from suspects with no alibi and plenty of rye, while the chief, salty and peppered, said it was murder most fowl—eggsecutive decision—case clucked and dried.
Detective Barnaby Krill smoked a cigarette like an alibi—thin, crumbling, and liable to blow away—while the rain groped the city's buttresses in a manner both moist and felonious, and the corpse on my carpet kept bleeding on the evidence, which was me, mostly, except for the parts that weren't, legally speaking.
Captain Thaddeus Brambletoe adjusted his eye patch he didn't need (for it was his knee that was glass), as the map tattooed on his back (by a monk with hiccups) whispered directions to the Forbidden Archipelago in a voice like wet corduroy, while the ocean, crouched like a damp panther, prepared to adventure him whether he liked it or not.
On the night the butcher met his mince-tress, the steaks were high and the thyme was of the essence, as he tenderly whisked her off her feet (which was a feat), promising they'd meat again come mourning, though their romance—so rare it was practically uncooked—would inevitably be ground down by gristly circumstances, a cleaver case of tender-loin-eliness.
It was a humid twilight of the heart, when love, like a soggy croissant left on a park bench, flaked despair into Miranda's bosom as Bradley's eyes—two lukewarm cappuccinos behind fogged spectacles—stared at her with the intensity of a malfunctioning toaster craving bread it could never legally marry.
It was the kind of murder that sneaks up on you like yesterday's leftovers: cold, greasy, and smelling faintly of regret, thought Detective Dirk Drizzle, adjusting his trench coat (beige but emotionally navy), as neon rain slithered down the alley and into evidence bag B, which he labeled 'A' by mistake to throw the killer off the scent, including his.
The moon, a lachrymose cantaloupe weeping rindless pearls upon the velvet soup of night, sighed through the alleyways like a perfumed accordion, while my heart—an overripe chandelier swaying in the draft of destiny's mildewed parlor—clinked its crystal regrets, spilling sonnets like gravy over the buttery mashed potatoes of fate.
It was a parched and dusty afternoon—the kind that made a tumbleweed cough—when Sheriff Buckaroo J.

It was a dark and stormy vacuum, the kind of interstellar gloom that makes a warp drive sigh, as Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his chrome feelings and peered heroically through the porthole at a quantum paradox doing donuts in a mauve nebula, while the ship's AI wept static and smelled like laser-fried destiny.
The moon, a languid custard of celestial melancholy, dribbled its pallid soup across the weeping cobblestones as my heart, a baroque accordion of sighs and sequins, wheezed operatically for Genevieve, whose eyelids—two velvet guillotines of destiny—blinked like wounded butterflies drowning in a goblet of perfume and destiny.
It was a dank and storm-drain night when I met Mucilla at the nose-dive bar, where the ale was snotty and the patrons blew air, and I, being a booger to begin with, picked her up only to discover she had issues I couldn't tissue, which I tried to wipe away but, alas, my efforts were in vain and vein.
It was a dark and glitchy night aboard the starship Epiphany when the cosmos, like a vending machine that had eaten my last credit, refused to deliver destiny, so I, Captain Nebula Q. Farnsworth-Smythe, pressed the universe's reset button—located inconveniently beside the airlock—initiating a reboot that smelled faintly of ozone, regret, and microwaved prophecy.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; the star-rain fell in tachyonic torrents—except when an errant wormhole sneezed, scattering time like glitter on a galactic craft table—while Captain Dirk Quantum, whose jaw had its own moon, adjusted his feelings to warp nine and heroically forgot the airlock was open.
It was a crime that left the heir in the air, for the manor's sole soul had been filleted from the family like a red herring, stake through the heart of their rare relations, and I, Detective Shallot, had to meat the challenge head-on, mustard my courage, and ketchup to the saucy suspect before things turned rotten to the corps.
It was a damp and seedy evening at the salad bar, where I romained calm while the lettuce pray and the dressing room undressed my emotions; I kneaded answers, but the stakes were high—sirloined by a prime suspect whose alibi was baloney, mustard up bravado, and a relish for the wurst.
It was the kind of murder that made the city blink twice and then pretend it hadn't seen anything, the corpse reclining on the linoleum like yesterday's lasagna left out in a heat wave, while I, Detective Dirk Drabble, sniffed for clues with the sensitive nose that had cost me two marriages and my sense of smell.
On the dawn that wasn't punctual (owing, perhaps, to clouds misfiled by the sky's clerk), Captain Barnaby Throttle—navigator, raconteur, and wearer of boots squeakier than truth—unfurled the map that smelled of grandmothers and gunpowder, announcing destiny to a crew who'd misplaced their courage, their oars, and, regrettably, the boat they were standing in.
It was a neon and binary night; the stars blinked like low-battery LEDs while the antimatter rain drizzled upward—except where gravity took a coffee break—spattering the titanium gutters of Neo-London as my chronospleen hummed ominously, insisting, in its damp way, that destiny had forgot to install the latest firmware update.
On the twelfth midnight of the thirteen moons, when the fog lay like unbuttered mashed potatoes over the cobblestones, the Ancient Prophecy (as handwritten in damp crayon on the back of a cursed tavern menu) awoke and cleared its throat, exhaling a draft so malevolent it chapped the souls of all who smelled it.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat sagged like a wet baguette stuffed with unanswered questions, squinted through the Venetian blinds at a city so guilty even the pigeons wore ankle monitors, while the corpse on his floor stubbornly refused to confess, bleeding alibis that pooled like ketchup waiting for fries that would never arrive.
It was a damp and morally clammy evening when I, Dirk Gravel, private investigator by trade and hobby, found the corpse of Mrs. Marmalade sprawled like yesterday's laundry across the fainting couch (which was not fainting, to be clear), and the clues—three, or possibly four—winked at me like guilty oysters in a bowl of legal soup.
On that velvet twilight, swollen with perfumes like a perfumed bruise, the moon perspired buttery tears upon the quivering cobblestones, while my heart, a baroque hummingbird trapped inside a lace-lined mausoleum of destiny, beat its feathery fists against the brocade of fate, which smelled faintly of lilacs, old soup, and inevitable, succulent catastrophe.
Beyond the tenth moon of Bratwurst-12, where the vacuum wheezed like an asthmatic harmonica and the stars blinked like tired routers, Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum mustache, set phasers to "maybe," and prepared to hypersneeze the starcruiser through a wormhole shaped suspiciously like his ex's voicemail icon, destiny-ish and somewhat sticky.
On a fog as thick as porridge (the medieval kind, not the modern instant stuff), London unbuttoned its damp shirt to the year 1536, and young Giles—whose destiny was braided like a louse-ridden wig with kings, codpieces, and a particularly judgmental turnip—strode forth, quill cocked like a musket, to write history before it inconveniently happened.
It was a night like a suspect's alibi—full of holes and smelling faintly of fish—when I, Dirk Mallory, PI and part-time gluten-free life coach, found the corpse sprawled like yesterday's laundry across the mayor's fainting couch, clutching a monogrammed spork and a clue so obvious it practically subpoenaed me in Comic Sans.
When Trevor's gaze collided with Bernice's at the all-you-can-eat salad bar (next to the sneeze guard glistening like destiny's window), their hearts—two microwaved burritos of longing—burst open with oozing passion, and he knew, as surely as croutons resist sogginess, that their love would be forever, or at least until dessert.
It was a dark and stormy vacuum, the kind that howled silently across the nebula like a banshee with its mic muted, when Captain Nebulon Q.

It was a bright and thunderous dawn when I, Barnaby Quill, hero by appointment only, unfurled the map that smelled like old sandwiches and destiny (we were somewhere between the equator and lunchtime), set my compass to 'north-ish,' and leapt aboard the creaking schooner of fate, whose captain swore the sea was mostly optional this season.
It was a boisterously silent vacuum of space, except where it wasn't, which was everywhere, as Captain Nebula Jones (no relation) adjusted the quantum-bevel hyperwrench of destiny on Starship Indescribable, whose AI—prone to sonnets and spontaneous rebooting—sighed in binary while the universe's last taco stand winked out with a belch of neon entropy.
On a foggy morn in ye olde 1588 (or thereabouts, give or take a fortnight and a leap year), when Queen Elizabeth's ruff choked England like a lacey noose of destiny, I, Bartholomew Thistlewick—humble turnip-auditor and occasional war-poet—perceived history reversing its cart through time's cul-de-sac, wheels squealing like outraged geese at the beheading buffet.
It was a moist and swooning evening when Desiree first beheld Trevor across the discount fondue buffet, and her heart, like a microwaved marshmallow left too long, collapsed sweetly onto itself while his eyes, two chlorinated hotel pools at midnight, promised a passion that would cling to them like gum on destiny's shoe.
It was a moist Tuesday when Desire, wearing a discount trench coat and smelling faintly of cinnamon gum and regret, sidled into Brenda's cardiac foyer and rang the doorbell of her feelings so violently that the tiny porcelain Cupid on her mantelpiece developed a stress fracture and fell in love with the carpet.
After my fiancée left me for a mime—she said our love had no words—I tried to move on, but every pass was intercepted by life's tight end, so now, pun-dit that I am, I can only court disaster, judge my chances, and appeal to a higher steak while my sole remains hopelessly fillet-ed, on porpoise.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jaw could chisel ice cubes and whose trench coat smelled like last week's alibi, sloshed into the crime scene where the victim lay as dead as a doornail that had given up carpentry; the widow's crocodile tears swam upstream, my brain did long division with a blunt pencil, and the city's neon blinked 'maybe' at me.
It was a binary and stormy night on Planet Spreadsheet-9, where the moons tabbed between columns of despair, and Captain Nebula Jones, whose cheekbones were sharper than a quantum spork, rebooted his love life by pressing CTRL+ALT+ELope while the spaceship's melancholic AI sighed in emoji and the stars buffered forever.
It was a humid and unexpectedly crunchy dawn when Captain Dirk Thunderflame, clutching a map drawn in invisible ink that everyone could see, heroically tiptoed across the screaming jungle floor toward the volcano that was both extinct and yet punctual, while his mustache, braver than him, navigated by the smell of fear and cinnamon.
When Detective Cole Slaw was assigned the cold cuts case on a dark and stormy knish, he knew he'd have to meat expectations, but his partner, a sage with too much thyme on her hands, told him to lettuce romaine calm, or else their plans would go a-rye and they'd relish nothing but bitter dill-usions.
It was a damp night soggy with criminality when I, Detective Dirk Mulligan—whose eyes are like two weary searchlights cutting through a custard fog—lurched into the alley where the corpse lay politely face-down beside a jealous trash can, and every clue screamed in whispering silence that the killer was either everyone or, inconveniently, me.
It was a damp and clammy mourning when I found the case file—soggy with de-tales—because the victim, a pun-slinging butcher named Hal O'Beef, had been tenderized by a mallet-of-intent, and I, a loaffully wedded PI, swore I'd rise to the occasion, crust whoever did it, and meat out just desserts, stake my life on it, for old thyme's sake.
On the eve of the Magna Carta (a quaint little parchment, like a medieval selfie but with more barons), the moon, rounder than King John's waistline and twice as peevish, slopped its milky porridge over Runnymede as quills bristled like hedgehogs and destiny—wearing muddy shoes—tracked footprints across the delicate doily of England's future.
It was a bold and tepid dawn when Barnaby Questington, gripping his grandmother's monogrammed machete like a handshake with destiny, tiptoed onto the creaking pier of Port Perilous where gulls screamed approximations of encouragement and the map—tattooed backward onto his left buttock after a regrettable raffle—twitched toward adventure like a caffeinated weather vane.
It was a moist and tepid evening when Trevor, whose eyes were the color of jealous avocados left too long in the salad bar, confessed to me at the bus stop that his heart—squeaky as a new shoe and twice as tight—had imprinted my soul like a poorly aligned fax, forever jammed on "us."
It was a clammy sort of midnight when Detective Lance Gravel, whose jaw could chisel Parmesan and whose past was a chandelier of broken promises, tiptoed into the crime scene like a ballerina wearing cinder blocks, noting with professional disgust that the corpse—rudely horizontal—reeked of guilt, oregano, and suspiciously premeditated gravity.
It was a moonless noon in the Kingdom of Gloom, when the castle's gargoyles perspired like nervous boulders and the wizard-prince Balderdash—whose eyes were twin puddles of midnight marmalade—unscrolled the Cursed Papyrus of Screamology, summoning an eldritch fog that smelled faintly of wet dragon socks and destiny's unwashed armpit.
It was a bright and stormy vacuum; the stars fizzed like flat soda in the galaxy's chipped goblet while Captain Nebbish, whose jawline was classified as a minor moon, instructed the ship's Mood-Driven Engine to engage at Plausibility Factor 9—whereupon time hiccupped, smelt faintly of burnt toast, and politely reversed his last three bad decisions.
It was high noon at precisely eleven-fifty-three when the sun squatted on the prairie like a fat landlord, the tumbleweeds tumbled with professional clumsiness, and my spurs jingled like guilty secrets, as Sheriff Lint's mustache cast a longer shadow than the church, while my horse, Mortgage, refused to budge without better terms.
It was high noon at precisely 3:17, when the sun slouched like a lazy outlaw over a horizon crowded with cacti whispering rumors in pricks, and Sheriff Laramie's mustache—two tumbleweeds with a law degree—twinkled ominously as spurs clinked like semicolons editing the silence and a nervous tumbleweed shot first, missing the town entirely.
It was a muggy night, the kind that sweats on you like a guilty conscience at a sauna, when I, Detective Dirk McHardcase (retired but not really), found the corpse of Mrs. Petunia von Moneybags breathing suspiciously little on her Persian rug, which tied the room together except for the blood, the motive, and my shoelaces.
Once upon a time, at precisely bedtime o'clock, in a gumdrop-colored suburb where clouds wore training wheels (for safety), little Timmy Tiddlewink—whose eyes were the exact shade of a well-behaved blueberry—prepared to learn a Very Important Lesson about sharing, responsibility, and the proper filing of feelings in alphabetical order.
It was on a lukewarm Tuesday when Clarissa's heart, shaped like a microwaved croissant, thawed for Nigel, whose eyes were the color of Bluetooth pairing lights and whose whisper, moist as a freshly sneezed blessing, promised forever the way coupons promise savings: in small print, expiring immediately.
It was a stormy night, and I was under the weathered leather whether I weathered it or not, when Detective Al B. Trary said the butchered case was a cut above the rest but below the belt—our prime suspect baker kneaded dough, needed dough, and left crumbs of evidence we couldn't whisk away, despite my cereal killer instincts.
Like a baroque peacock molting moonbeams into a puddle of perfumed eternity, Clarabelle's heart—an overripe nectarine of nuance—throbbed cathedrally beneath the corseted twilight, while the chandelier of destiny sneezed crystal constellations upon the doilied horizon, and every sigh she exhaled braided itself, loudly, into the velvet hush like a fainting swan knitting thunder.
It was a sleek and glitchy dawn; the twin suns booted up with a wheeze over Beta-Biscuit-IV as my quantum heart (factory refurbished) buffered, lagged, and then bravely autoupdated to Love v2.0, while meteors pinged the hull like notifications I swiped away because destiny had already added me as spam.
Her heart throbbed like a microwaved burrito (the cheap store-brand kind, not the artisanal ones Brad favored before the incident with the swan), oozing emotions and a little resentment, as his gaze—wet, stormy, and possibly contagious—drizzled over her soul like expired salad dressing and whispered, 'We should be us, eventually, probably.'
Captain Buck Blunderstone (whose chin had the firmness of a well-baked ham and the ethics of a carnival claw machine) adjusted his compass to north-ish as the sun rose in the west like a surprised yolk, vowing to conquer the uncharted Jungle Desert Fjord before tea or indigestion—whichever attacked first.
It was a sunny night in the Happy Dimpledale Orphanage—sunny because the moon was pretending, as moons do when they want to be noticed (don't interrupt, Timmy), and all the giggling ducklings lined up by height, weight, and emotional availability to learn Sharing from Mr. Crinkle, who shared everyone else's cookies first so they'd know how it feels.
It was an evening swaddled in velveteen gloom, wherein the moon, a lachrymose pearl suspended from heaven's drooling lip, wept mayonnaise light upon the cobblestones, and the wind, perfumed with the melancholy of forgotten cucumbers, gossiped through the gutters like an old aunt wearing too many bangles of rain.
It was a humid and perfumed twilight when Clarissa's heart, resembling a microwaved croissant, laminated in greasy layers of longing and regret, puffed toward Eduardo—whose eyes, two oversteeped teabags of destiny, leaked tannic passion—while the saxophone of fate honked somewhere off-key behind a dumpster that smelled like roses wearing deodorant.
It was a night as honest as a politician's alibi, and I, Detective Dirk Dander, lone wolf of the Seventh Precinct (temporarily suspended for insubornation, which is like insubordination but more personal), followed the breadcrumb trail of clues—cigarette ash like dandruff on destiny—into a cul-de-sac that screamed dead end, except for the corpse that wouldn't cooperate.
As the voluptuous moon ladled its buttery luminescence over the swooning, perfumed city like a lover's gravy on the mashed potatoes of destiny, my heart—an overripe mango upholstered in velvet sighs—burst into operatic confetti, while the boulevard, coquettishly moist with nostalgia, flexed its cobblestones like pectorals beneath a silk-shirted drizzle.
The moon, a pallid custard of celestial yearning, dribbled its lachrymose yolk over the trembling rooftops as Veronica—whose eyes were two wounded sapphires set in a soufflé of face—exhaled a sigh so baroque it curled the wallpaper like a wilting trombone, promising destiny, dampness, and possibly soup.
It was a treacherously sunny dusk when Barnaby "Thunderpants" McCracken, gripping his heirloom compass that pointed mostly to regret, vaulted aboard the wheezing dirigible-canoe toward the Uncharted Archipelago of Certain Peril, where legends promised gold, glory, and a mild rash, while seagulls applauded like damp handkerchiefs and the horizon leaned in to eavesdrop.
It was a daring and stormy dawn when Captain Buck Throttle, a jaw like a granite cliff and a hat like destiny, unfolded a map so ancient it coughed dust in Morse code, while his compass spun like a ballerina with vertigo toward an X that marked not treasure exactly, but something noisily mysterious.
The night slouched over Gristle City like a damp trench coat two sizes too desperate when I, Detective Dirk Mulligan—whose middle name is Danger, if you count silent letters—stirred my coffee with a bullet for flavor and noticed the corpse on my desk had left a note in lipstick that read 'Don't look for me,' which I immediately investigated.
It was a moist evening of destiny when Claribel, whose eyes were the exact hexadecimal color of hospital scrubs, collided heartwise with Douglas, a man shaped like a heroic bread loaf, and their love detonated softly like a microwaved grape, oozing fate and gluten through the torn baguette of time.
On a velveteen evening thick as overripe plums, when the moon draped herself like a fainting duchess upon the chaise longue of the heavens, I felt destiny—perfumed, perspiring, and slightly cross-eyed—tiptoe into my heart's vestibule, jangling a key ring of sighs while the city's cobblestones swooned in synchronized, self-congratulatory despair.
It was a moist and thunderously tender evening when Desiree, whose eyes were the color of indecision and whose hair cascaded like linguine forgotten in a colander, collided heart-first with Bradman, a man-shaped avalanche of cologne and promises, and their love ignited like a scented candle left on a radiator, sputtering heroically against the drafts of destiny and common sense.
It was high noon on the prairie—unless you asked the sun, which seemed tardier than a churchgoing coyote—when Sheriff Ezekiel "Dust-Mouth" Crenshaw (so named for reasons both obvious and mysterious) clanked into the sagging saloon, his spurs explaining cosmology to the floorboards while tumbleweeds auditioned for tumble-rights outside and the whiskey smelled like a divorce between a barrel and skunk.
When Mayor Hamlin was found in the charcuterie with a cold cut, the city went from prosciutto to proscihuh-oh, and I, a rye private eye with a gluten for punishment, kneaded the clues, loafed around suspects, and vowed to make the killer baguette on their knees before I toast another soul.
It was a humid evening in the food court of destiny when Clarissa's heart, a microwaved burrito wrapped in the clingfilm of fate, exploded into lukewarm longing at the sight of Brett, whose eyes were the exact color of Wi‑Fi, strong yet password-protected, and whose voice buttered her soul like a dropped croissant.
Upon the velveteen bosom of the night, where moonbeams coagulated like spilled custard upon the trembling soufflé of destiny, I—Archibald Thistlewhip, orphaned connoisseur of sighs—unfurled my soul like a perfumed umbrella in a hurricane of longing, while lamplight wept buttery tears onto cobblestones that remembered, too loudly, the sensual footnotes of yesterday.
On the opalescent eve of destiny, when the moon perspired pearls onto the trembling bosom of the quivering, buttered sky, I—Percival Thistledown, baron of heartbreak and amateur taxidermist of emotions—unsheathed my sighs like velvet scimitars, carving arabesques upon the custard of time as fate curdled politely in its rhinestone teacup.
It was a quantumly foggy afternoon on Mars, the kind with sandstorms that smell like Wi‑Fi and destiny, when Captain Nebula Jones—voted Most Likely to Time-Travel Backwards in high school—discovered his spaceship was pregnant with smaller, sassier spaceships, which was awkward because he'd only held hands with the warp drive during a meteor shower.
It was a dank and punny night, the currant running through the alley shocking to the marrow while a cereal killer left flakes of clues and a trail of thyme—clearly he'd mustard the nerve—though the sole witness lost his soul at the scene, claiming he couldn't ketchup to events, which, to be frank, were the wurst.
It was a quantum midnight on Nebula-9, where the stars blinked like low-battery indicators in the cosmic dashboard and Captain Vex Throttle (GED, not that it matters in zero-g) clenched his nostalgia-warmed laser-sword—technically a "photonic filament rod," but the manual was in Space Latin—while the ship's AI, S.A.D.I.E., purred updates about imminent non-imminent doom in a voice like microwaved velvet dipped in static.
It was a crisp and soggy morning in the Year of Our Lord 1588, when the sun slouched above London like a lazy beadle punching in late, gilding the reeking Thames (which flowed like pewter stew) and the Queen's ruff crackled with destiny while my quill, trembling heroically, prepared to witness the Spanish Armadillo's approach.
It was a night like an alibi—full of holes and badly dressed—when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jaw could open envelopes and whose trench coat smelled like an old confession, found the corpse sprawled like a misplaced comma in the greasy spoon, bleeding ketchuply, except it wasn't ketchup, unless ketchup carries a .38 and writes 'u did this' in cursive gravy.
Detective Basil Thyme—seasoned, yet still the salt of the earth—stalked the culprit through the deli of fate, cutting corners like cold cuts, mustard his courage, made mayo misteak or two, but lettuce be frank: he relished the case, even if it left him feeling bleu.
It was a dark and stormy nebula, the kind that gets stuck between your teeth of time, and as Captain Dirk Skylark (whose middle name is Classified, for reasons) revved the starship's mood engine to maybe, the galaxies perspired tachyons like nervous pigeons while destiny, misfiled under D for Dumpster, unfolded with the delicate grace of exploding Tupperware.
On a night blacker than the vacuum behind a dead pixel, the starship Nostril-7 wheezed through the cilantro-scented nebula, its captain—who was mostly human if you discounted the loaner tentacle and the mood ring spleen—consulting a glitching horoscope app to chart a course through a wormhole shaped suspiciously like his ex's passive-aggressive smile.
It was a night so velveteen with gloom that the moon, like a bashful pearl drowned in a goblet of squid ink, refused to RSVP to the heavens' cotillion, while the boulevards—those silver-buckled shoelaces of the city—sighed perfumes of damp brick and melodrama, cradling my destiny like a fainting goat in perfumed lace.
On a foggily historical morning in 1588 (give or take a leap year), when Elizabeth's ruff rustled like a starched thundercloud and the Armada bobbed like an anxious salad, young Percival Quill, my unreliable ancestor, sharpened his quill-sword for destiny, or at least for journaling, which in those days passed theatrically for heroism and cardio.
The sun hung over Dead Mule Junction like a jaundiced flapjack on a rusty nail, and Sheriff Buck 'Two-Socks' Mallory (so named because he owned precisely that many) squinted heroically into the tumbleweeded horizon where justice, like a reluctant cow with opinions, refused to be milked, even as spurs jingled their mournful mariachi of fate.
On the night the scone-cold killer struck the poultrygeist at the coop—murder most fowl—the town's gluten-free gumshoe, pressed for thyme and short on raisin, sifted through the currant events with whey too much feeling, determined to cumin first, dill later, and ketchup to the grate expectations of a ham-handed public.
As the sun exploded over the jungle like an overripe egg flung by a vengeful chicken of destiny, Dirk Barometer-Chance adjusted his squeaking leather fedora, consulted his compass that bravely pointed to Yesterday, and vowed to find the Lost City of Eventually, right after locating his other sock and a less opinionated machete.
As dawn yawned over 1789 Paris like a tired baguette on a picnic blanket, Marie-Claire, whose eyes were the blue of aristocratic tax exemptions, clutched her tricolor monochrome shawl while the guillotine, a sort of patriotic paper-cutter for heads, cleared its throat delicately, promising history would trend forever, or at least until tea.
It was a clean getaway, I could tell by the mess, because nothing says innocence like footprints in spilled marinara leading away from the corpse like red breadcrumbs to a city that never sleeps without a nightlight, and I, Detective Dirk Dander, smelled a rat, or possibly the Parmesan, which in this town amounts to the same perpetrator.
It was a bright and drizzly nap-time of a morning when little Timmy Tiddlewink, whose pockets were stuffed with bravery, raisins, and a possibly alive caterpillar named Sir Wriggleton III, embarked to find the End of the Rainbow, which local experts (his socks) assured him was filing paperwork beneath his left shoe, like a shy leprechaun with stage fright.
It was a fog-sodden afternoon in 1066 (which, for those keeping score, was a very good year for conquest), when Harold's mustache—bristling like a hedgehog with an attitude problem—quivered at destiny's dial-up tone, while parchment clouds scrolled overhead, buffering slowly, as if history had the wrong password to Hastings.
As the sun rose like a bashful lemon over the horizon of Destiny, Captain Dirk Thunderpants adjusted his antique monocle and his newer sense of purpose, unfurling a map so old it smelled of history class while the compass spun like a seasick breakdancer, pointing to treasure everywhere except where we stood—beside a whispering volcano and an unhelpfully bilingual parrot.
It was the kind of future that smelled like burnt USBs and destiny, when Captain Nebula Jones, whose eyes were the approximate hexadecimal of #00FFsad, heroically rebooted the starship Friendship during the galaxy's Tuesday (for space has days, don't argue), while meteors politely queued like British scones and time itself hiccuped through wormholes like spaghetti sucked by a black hole.
On the eve of destiny (Tuesday, according to the Julian calendar), when Caesar's sandals squeaked through the Senate (for it is in Rome that our scene lies) like geese negotiating a puddle, Octavia—who was not yet old, though time, like a bored tailor, measured her hems—clutched a scroll that smelled of empire, olives, and the treasonous cologne of history.
Their love crashed into the small town of Muckleby like a swan wearing denim colliding with a screen door: feathers of destiny, rivets of fate, and the squeak of yearning, while Greta, moist as a forgotten sponge, gazed at Trevor's soul-patch mustache, which hovered above his lip like a romantic caterpillar in tax season.
In the galactically vast void of space, which is like the ocean but wetter with photons, Captain Dirk Nebula heroically toggled the Hyper-Quantum Warp Drive™—a toaster-sized behemoth humming abdominally—while asteroids (rocks in space) politely exploded in slow motion; time hiccupped, belched, and asked for a napkin.
It was a brave and cowardly dawn when Trevor McSkirmish, gripping a damp map like a wet burrito of destiny and guided by a compass that pointed mostly at itself, strode into the jungle—past rumors, through quicksand, under an offended condor—to rescue the treasure that legends swore was guarded by a volcano with trust issues.
The moon, a languid custard of melancholy drizzled across the trembling velvet of the heavens, sighed its pearly ennui upon the village like a perfumed anvil, while my heart—an overstuffed chaise lounge embroidered with sighs and complicated destiny—reclined, fainting, into the parlor of forever, where even the begonias perspired with rococo inevitability.
It was a damp and pun-ishing evening when Detective Herb Thyme, fresh from a-salt and buttery, was called to the crumb scene, where the victim, a gluten for punishment, had clearly met his baker's dozen—proof positive, you might say, that things would only rise from bad to wurst, as suspects began to loaf, ketchup, and relish alibis.
Love struck Delilah like a damp baguette hurled across a moonlit deli—soft yet startling—while Brad, whose eyes were the color of a blue he'd once seen on a weather map over Toledo, whispered promises so tender they curdled the nonfat yogurt of her heart, which had lactose issues.
It was a night like a suspect's alibi—full of holes and smelling like cheap cologne—when Detective Dirk Drizzle, whose eyes were piano keys that only played the blues, sauntered into the crime scene where the corpse lay extremely deceased, marinated in mystery and surrounded by clues as subtle as brass knuckles tap-dancing on a librarian.
It was a humid night in Gristleburg, the kind that makes trench coats cling like needy octopi, when I, Detective Dirk Gravel (licensed, jaded, lactose-intolerant), discovered the victim—Mayor Puddington—lying as dead as yesterday's donut, except for the faintly suspicious breathing that screamed "murder" in Morse code through his nostrils.
As the moon slouched like a half-deflated croissant over the municipal duck pond, Clarissa felt Cupid's stubby elbow nudge her spleen, for there—leaning against a vending machine that hiccuped out lukewarm colas—stood Bramble Thatchford, whose eyes were two damp commas pausing in the paragraph of destiny that I, unfortunately, must now annotate with passion.
It was a breezy swelter of a dawn when Captain Basil Forthright, whose mustache curled like a question mark searching for its answer, unfolded the damp, screaming map that led, via jungles as thick as gravy and seas as salty as tears and twice as wet, to treasure rumored to be priceless, or at least moderately expensive, if you bargained hard.
It was a crime to remember and a mystery to forget, the kind of homicide that crept into the city like a cat wearing tap shoes (size 11, men's), leaving footprints of suspicion on the shag-carpet of justice, as Detective Dirk Hardcastle—divorced, lactose-intolerant, yet lactose-curious—lit his last first cigarette and swore to quit tomorrow.
Like a velvet tsunami of moonbeams pouring from the cracked teapot of destiny, Desiree swept into the mausoleum-cum-ballroom with a sigh so opulent it upholstered the air, while the chandelier perspired diamonds and the night itself blushed mauve, ashamed to witness such sumptuous sorrow writhing like buttered eels in the custard of my heart.
Midnight draped the village like an overcooked velvet pudding, oozing shadows that slithered coquettishly over cobblestones as the moon, a pale and perspiring coin in Heaven's hesitant pocket, sighed its lactose light upon my heart, which throbbed like a harpsichord dropped down a staircase of destiny scented faintly of lavender and regret.
It was a night so guilty it would've pleaded the Fifth, with rain dropping alibis all over my trench coat while sirens wailed like widows at a half-off funeral, and the city, wearing neon bruises, lay beside a corpse trying to pass as a rug, stabbed by a monogrammed dagger that kept shouting, "Me."
The moon, a weeping custard of nocturnal mayonnaise, dribbled its pearly ennui across the soufflé of the sky as Reginald, whose eyes were twin violins sawing at the catgut of destiny, tiptoed like a thunderclap through the lavender-scented alley of his heart, where memories, those obese hummingbirds of yesteryear, hovered, belching nectar into the chalice of his irretrievably moist soul.
It was a dark and stormy knight who, having lost his bearings, took a roll down Baker Street, where the case seemed crumby, the victim was toast, and I, a rye private eye with a gluten for punishment, kneaded answers I couldn't whisk, battering suspects until the truth finally rose, half-baked and wholly unpalatable.
It was a moist evening in the cafeteria of destiny, where the cappuccino machine panted like a shy walrus and my heart, a heated croissant of yearning laminated with regret, flaked loudly as Trevor—whose eyes were the color of Wi‑Fi when it's good—entered, igniting in me a romance so inevitable it felt optional.
On a dark and stormy k-night (the tin-can horseback sort, not the time), Lady Wanda Lust met Sir Loin at the royal barbecue, where he had the chops to court, she had no beef but plenty of beef, and their chaste chase, marinated in thyme and poor timing, couldn't meat halfway without steaking their reputations on the grill of amour.
When Detective Thyme, pressed for time, arrived at the deli homicide where the victim—Sal Ami—lay in cold cuts beside a note pleading "lettuce romaine calm" dusted with cumin to "cumin peace," I knew it was murder most fowl (the chicken was crossed), so though I had a steak in it, I couldn't let it meat a grate end, and I mustard the courage to dill with the facts and hope the perp would ketchup before it all went from bad to wurst.
It was a crime scene you could really sink your teeth into, I mustard say, as the body lay sprawled on the deli tile with a baloney hue, and I, a seasoned investigator who relishes details, tried to ketchup with the evidence before it spoiled, though my partner, Mayo, kept needling me about taking it with a grain of salt.
Their love crashed into the cafeteria of destiny like a shopping cart with one squeaky wheel, scattering napkins of fate and puddings of passion, while Trevor's eyes—two lukewarm cappuccinos left on the counter of eternity—steamed toward Imogene's heart, which beat like a Wi‑Fi router bravely blinking in a storm of unplugged emotions.
It was a dank and stormy knight, whose armor was rusting for lack of proper knight-trition, and as I squired away my time writing, I lance-d paragraphs, joustified plot holes, and mailed in characters so chain-gingly dull that even the dragon, bored stiff, let out a yawn of fire and retired to its lair-y tale.
Captain Bartholomew 'Thunderknees' McGuffin, whose jaw was as square as a disappointed waffle iron, stood on the creaking deck of the S.S. Audacity clutching a soggy map to Nowhere, while destiny hiccuped, the compass spun like a caffeinated ballerina, and his parrot whispered, "After this, boss, the real adventure begins backward."
It was a quantumly humid dusk on Mars's Night Side, where the stars blinked like laggy Wi‑Fi LEDs across the velvet firmware of space, and Captain Nebula Jones (no relation) holstered his laser-scented nostalgia, adjusted his anti-gravity mustache, and prepared to reboot destiny by turning it off and on again, forever.
It was a night so guilty the stars pleaded the Fifth, and I, Nick "Noodle" Noland—licensed, bonded, and recently divorced from my better judgment—found the corpse lounging on the linoleum like yesterday's lasagna (extra sauce, hold the alibi), while the ceiling fan confessed everything in whispers the tape recorder refused to understand.
It was a grime and slimey night when I, Brisket Forrester, a cut above the rest but still tender to a fault, found myself in the seedy quarter known as Sir Loin, where every butchered sentence was rare, every ham-handed remark well done, and every mystery, alas, baloney at its wurst.
On a night so dark the moon wore sunglasses and the stars called in sick, the ancient castle (which was older than time, and also damp) exhaled a sigh like a cryptic accordion as Sir Niblet the Tremulous unsheathed his squealing sword to face the prophecy's moldy breath that smelled exactly like destiny and onions.
Detective Lance Grimsby, whose trench coat flapped like a wounded pelican in the siren-salted breeze of a city that never learned to recycle its sins, squinted at the chalk outline shaped suspiciously like a regretful croissant and declared, with a gravitas moist as week-old coffee, that the murderer had definitely, probably, almost certainly struck again, allegedly.
Upon the velveteen bosom of twilight's sighing teacup, where stars dribbled like sequins from a careless debutante of the cosmos, my heart, a damp origami swan of yearning, flapped feebly through the custard-thick air toward destiny's chaise longue, which smelled faintly of wilted violets and grandmother's inconsolable doilies.
The sun slumped behind the cactus-pronged horizon like an overcooked egg sliding off a chipped plate, while Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit (whose mustache curled like pan-fried barbed wire) clanked into the wheezing saloon, his spurs jangling like nervous tambourines as tumbleweeds, coyotes, and destiny itself queued outside for a shootout at precisely high noon-ish.
It was a twilight of mauve melancholy, draped like a velvet bruise across the horizon, where the sun, a bashful yolk, oozed languidly into the custard of destiny, while my heart—an overfull teacup of yearning—trembled on its saucer ribs, spilling fragrant sighs that perfumed the puddles with the cologne of forever.
It was a fog so thick it wore a badge, clogging the alleys like cold gravy, when I, Nick Nickel, P.I. (Priceless Investigator), found the corpse—technically alive but dead inside—sprawled across Tuesday, bleeding secrets that smelled like cheap alibis and yesterday's rain, which, frankly, had a criminal record.
It was the kind of morning that slapped you with destiny like a wet tortilla, as Captain Bartholomew "Boomerang" Crumplethwaite unfurled a map tattooed on a molting iguana, the ink weeping like widows and pointing us—through jungles that perspired, oceans that needed ironing, and a volcano that cleared its throat—toward the treasure of Probably Certain Doom.
It was a dark and stormy nebula, the kind that drizzled cosmic soup on the starship's windshield (which was metaphorical, because of vacuum), when Captain Zaxx Quantum—whose jawline could cut tungsten but not tension—flipped the hyper-ultra-mega-warp lever to 'yikes' and felt time hiccup like a goat, burping yesterday into tomorrow's already-regrettable breakfast.
Upon the velveteen cusp of twilight's sigh, when the moon, that pallid custodian of nocturnal gossip, drooled pearlish mayonnaise across the trembling rooftops, my heart—a pomegranate of destiny—pulped itself noisily in my chest as fate, perfumed like a grandmother's armpit, pirouetted through my veins with the stealth of an anvil wearing slippers.
It was a neon-scented dawn on Sector 12B; the stars blinked like low-battery status LEDs while Captain Vrax (whose jawline had been upgraded to Version 3.1) heroically toggled the destiny switch on the HyperQuantum Friendship Drive, which hummed like a smug toaster learning ethics from its own crumbs.
It was a quantumly foggy epoch—Tuesday-ish—when Captain Nebula Jones, whose cheekbones were classified as exoplanets by three minor bureaucracies, piloted the starship IRS-1099 through the casserole-thick vacuum of Sector Beige, where time dilated like spandex and love, alas, remained tragically un-decrypted by even the sexiest algorithms.
It was a dark and stormy Knight, Sir Loin of Beef, who minced no words as he tenderized the stakes of our relationship, grilling me for answers while I tried to ketchup with the saucy details, but my alibis were half-baked and our thyme together, alas, was past-a point of no ret-turn.
On a morning as crisp as a newly minted denarius (for we are in Rome, or thereabouts, temporally speaking), Julius—no relation—strode through the Forum like a thundercloud in sandals, while gossip dripped from togas like olive oil from a disappointing salad, and history, bored of itself, queued politely to be conquered by his mediocre destiny.
When Detective Cole Slaw strode into the deli of iniquity, he knew the case was afootlong—someone had murdered the ham and framed the turkey, leaving only a roll call of crummy clues and a mustard-yellow note that said, "Lettuce pray; mayo the guilty party ketchup to justice."
The city oozed with guilt like a jelly-filled donut left on a radiator, and I, Detective Vince Gravel, squinted through my rain-splotched magnifying glass at the crime scene—a puddle, a lipstick, a suspiciously tidy alibi—while sirens bagpiped in the distance and the victim's silence refused to cooperate without a lawyer.
Her heart, a timid hamster on a broken treadmill of desire, skittered in its ribbed cage as Trevor—whose cologne smelled like overripe peaches arguing with a thunderstorm—took her clammy hand and whispered 'bonjourno' in a dialect unknown to man, and suddenly the moon blushed, the streetlamp swooned, and destiny forgot its lines.
It was a vacuum-fresh night in Sector 12B when Captain Nebula "Chuck" Stardash, whose jawline could cut titanium foil and whose heart uploaded feelings in beta, realized the galaxy was expanding not from physics but from loneliness, as the starship's warp-spleen burped chronophotons like reheated soup while constellations rearranged themselves to spell LOL in ancient Morse-binary.
It was a midnight like a badly microwaved burrito, hot in odd places and cold where it shouldn't be, as the haunted castle exhaled a sigh that sounded suspiciously like my name—Nigel—while moonlight dripped from the gargoyles' noses and the prophecy (which I hadn't read) tattooed itself on my goosebumps.
It was a moist evening when love, wearing mismatched socks and the expression of a confused cocker spaniel, tripped over my destiny like a grocery cart with a wobbly wheel, smashing my heart (BPA-free) into a thousand recyclable shards that glittered like discounted romance novels under fluorescent supermarket moonlight.
It was a humid evening when love, like a soggy croissant left on a radiator, puffed and wilted in Penelope's chest, and as Trevor's eyes—two chlorinated hotel pools reflecting the exit sign of destiny—met hers across the salad bar, her soul performed a clumsy cannonball into forever, splashing vinaigrette onto fate's polyester tablecloth.
In the twelfthish year of King Henry the Which-One-Again, when the plague had a buy-one-get-one vibe and peasants accessorized with turnips the way nobles accessorized with guilt, young Maudlin of Mudford set forth across the frowning moor (a smirk would have been unseemly), clutching destiny, dysentery, and a slightly used prophecy wrapped in damp vellum.
It was a crime most fowl, the chicken clearly crossed the line (and the road), leaving a trail of poultrygeist rumors and eggsistential dread, so I, a tender-loin-hearted gumshoe with a rare stake in the case, mustard my courage, thyme after thyme, to ketchup with the saucy culprit before the gravy consequences curdled our whey of life.
It was an adventurous dawn when heroism oozed like ketchup from the hotdog of destiny, and I, Bartholomew 'Skipper' Crankshaft, tightened my shoelaces with the steely resolve of a buttered otter, stepped onto the map (which was also my heart), and vowed to sail the Sahara before lunch, weather permitting and camel included.
It was a dry and dusty dusk on the prairie when Sheriff Cactus McGinty, whose mustache had seen more sunsets than a sundial in a blind man's pocket, rode his creaking horse—named Horse—into the town of Desolation, where the tumbleweeds rolled like nervous biscuits and the saloon piano twanged in self-defense.
It was a tapestry of yesteryear, frayed and yet surprisingly moist, when young Bartholomew (born in a year with plenty of numbers) strode across the cobblestoned Wi‑Fi of Tudor London, his doublet emotionally unavailable, his ruff whispering state secrets like a leaky quill into the ravenous ears of destiny.
Timmy Tumblesworth, aged seven-and-a-half (a crucial age, dear reader, for morals and molars), awoke on a Tuesday that felt like a Thursday in Tuesday's hand-me-downs to find his teddy, Sir Flufflebottom, elected Mayor of Under-the-Bed and Chancellor of Crumbs, proclaiming—between soggy cornflake confetti—that today they would bravely share, rescue, and discover why closets wheeze like dragons needing small inhalers.
It was a mournful mourning in the pun-derworld when Detective Al Dente, still reeling from his pasta, saw the victim—an electrician who'd been de-lighted, current-ly shocked, and left with bad conduct—lying by the butcher shop where no one could meat expectations, while the baker, needing dough, refused to whisk getting involved.
It was a ye olde and foggy afternoon, when King John, perspiring like a buttered eel in chainmail (which he wasn't wearing, but you get the idea), autographed, with a quill the size of a swan's regret, the Magna Carta—Latin for 'Big Paper'—thus inventing freedom, bureaucracy, and inconvenient parchment splinters all at once.
The moon draped itself like a damp velour curtain over the village of Spindlewick, sighing with the heavy perfume of destiny as raindrops—tiny crystal tragedians—flung themselves from the sky to die upon the cobbles, while my heart, a wounded marmot in brocade, gnawed the fringes of fate's ottoman with aristocratic despair.
It was a moist and meddlesome evening when Penelope's heart, shaped like a slightly dented valentine from the Bargain Bin of Destiny, fell headfirst into Trevor's gaze—a gaze the color of reheated spinach—and their souls, two confused pigeons in a food court, collided beak-first in a symphony of sticky, star-crossed swooning.
It was a murky noon in the city that never sweeps, when Detective Dirk Gristle, whose trench coat smelled like yesterday's alibis and whose eyes were the color of unsolved paperwork, discovered the corpse of justice itself slumped behind a dumpster behind the law, bleeding metaphors and counterfeit clues like a leaky percolator.
The sun slumped over Cactus Gulch like a busted egg yoke on a dusty plate, while tumbleweeds gossiped in the saloon doorway and my horse, Justice, exhaled halitosis so thick it could stop a bullet, as the sheriff squinted so hard his pupils unionized and the sky pulled on its evening chaps with a sigh.
Detective Vince Grackle, whose fedora hugged his scalp like a guilty secret stuck to a sweaty confession, knew the case was fishier than a tuna's alibi when the corpse (formerly alive) reclined politely on the parquet, while outside the neon smeared the rain like lipstick on the city's moral mirror, spelling Tuesday in blood.
It was a high-noon midnight of the soul on the prairie, where the tumbleweeds galloped faster than my horse named Mortgage, whose sighing saddle squeaked like a guilty harmonica, while Sheriff Cactus O'Malley twirled justice on his finger like a lukewarm bean and the horizon squinted back first.
It was a moon that had no business being full, bulging like an overripe eyeball over Gloomsmead, where the ancient prophecy (scribbled on a damp napkin by a wizard with gravy on his beard) foretold that at precisely tea-thirty, the dead would ring the doorbell and ask to borrow sugar.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; plasma drizzled through the asteroid cul-de-sacs—except when the ship's Wi-Fi (set to stun) buffered heroically—while Captain Vrax, whose cheekbones were forged in low gravity and whose heart password was "1234," gazed at the quantum horizon where time itself lagged like a glitched tutorial.
It was a mournful mourning in the deli of my heart, where I ham-fistedly mustard the courage to ketchup with destiny, only to relish the fact that my life was on a roll, until fate, crusty as a day-old bun, loafed around and baguette me into a jam.
The moon, a pallid yolk trembling in the coddled custard of the heavens, dribbled its lachrymose mayonnaise over the quivering rooftops, while my heart—garnished with the parsley of destiny and sautéed in the panicky butter of forbidden yearnings—sizzled like a tragic omelet flipped by Fate's greasy, perfumed, and ambiguously gloved hand.
It was a midnight more midnight than most midnights when I, Dirk Gravel, private detective and part-time notary, found the corpse of a mystery lying face-down in the alley like a rug that had been swept under the city, and I knew two things: somebody was guilty, and my trench coat was absorbing clues like a damp sponge in a rainstorm of lies.
It was the year 1066½, when destiny tripped on its own shoelaces at Hastings and fell face-first into the Norman Conquest, as Harold squinted into the gossiping English drizzle (which spoke fluent Old French already), while monks live-tweeted in illuminated margins and the Bayeux Tapestry unspooled like a medieval carpet warranty no one had actually read.
It was a dampish and suspicious night when I, Detective Dirk Gravel, sloshed down an alley where the rain pounded the dumpsters like a jury with mallets, cradling coffee blacker than a widow's tax audit, to gaze upon a corpse arranged like a semicolon, pausing between two crimes that refused to make a sentence.
On the night Morty, a mourning person by profession, met Urna at the crematorium mixer, sparks flew—then settled as ash—because their chemistry was grave, their banter deadpan, and though others said their romance was a stiff, they knew they'd urn their keep, coffin up jokes till rigor mortis do them part.
It was a stark and corny night when Private I, eyeing the scene with pupils dilated and teachers petting alibis, felt a grave mistake creeping up like a cemetery plot twist, and, sensing he was in deep kimchi, mustard the courage to ketchup with the suspect before the case went from bad to wurst.
The moon slouched over the crenelated molars of Castle Gingiva like a tired eyeball in a skull that had stopped trying, while in the dungeons below a necromancer with the breath of a damp library whispered ancient coupons to awaken a dragon made of moths, and every shadow politely screamed to avoid waking the ghosts.
On a Tuesday as moist as a poet's armpit, Desiree met Chadwick in the discount candle aisle, and their eyeballs tangled like two extension cords of fate, sparking a romance so torrid that even the store's automatic doors blushed open and shut at their heaving sighs, price tags fluttering like embarrassed cherubs.
Moonlight dribbled like buttery ectoplasm over the trembling cobblestones, while my soul—quivering like a soufflé in an earthquake—penned its own obituary in sighs, for Clarissa's eyes (two tragic aquariums of moist sapphire despair) had blinked, twice, which in our village constituted both a wedding vow and a thunderstorm.
It was a moonlit brunch of the heart, the croissants of our passion laminated with buttered destiny—except when my feelings (which were gluten-free, unlike Trevor's) flaked into crumbs of yearning that stuck to the napkin of fate, where our lips, like two confused Roombas, bumped repeatedly into the wainscoting of love.
It was a moist evening of the soul when Bradlynn first beheld Jocelyne across the discount candle aisle, and his heart, a flustered hamster on a buttered treadmill, sprinted toward destiny while her eyelashes—each a grieving violin—winked Morse code saying "Sale," which he translated as "soulmate," thereby igniting a passion like wet fireworks in a damp sock.
It was the Year of Our Lord 1533, give or take a fortnight depending on the Pope's mood swings, when Mistress Petunia Prattle (a seamstress of uncommon commonness) stitched destiny into a doublet so tight it squeaked, as London—reeking of pottage, plague, and progress—held its breath like a constipated choir awaiting a royal hiccup.
In the morgue's new fusion bistro—Where There's a Will, There's a Weigh—I kneaded closure on the cereal killer case, but every clue was half-baked: the victim had been heartlessly tenderized, liver let die, thyme of death uncertain, sole searched and found lacking, and the suspect, a butcher, cleaved to his alibi.
It was a moist and ominous twilight when the castle (which looked like a castle should, if one reads brochures) exhaled bats like confetti from a funeral piñata, while Sir Morbidus, whose eyes were two haunted raisins in a pudding of fear, unsheathed his squeaky sword to duel destiny, mildew, and his mother's prophecy (in that order).
It was an ordinary extraordinary dawn when Captain Barnaby Throttle, whose jaw was as square as a compass and twice as trustworthy (unlike the crew, who were neither), unfurled the mildew-crusted map that smelled like destiny and wet socks, vowing to find the Lost Volcano of Ice or perish heroically in a very survivable mishap.
It was a dark and stormy alibi, the kind that wore high heels and lies like lipstick, when Detective Brick Slabman—hard-boiled as a week-old egg left in a rain-soaked ashtray—found the corpse of Mayor Honesty face-down in a puddle of municipal transparency, clutching a clue so obvious it hid itself by screaming, "Nothing to see here," in invisible ink.
It was the best of times to upload one's consciousness and the wurst of times for meat (that is to say, bodies), as Captain Zorblax-47—half cyborg, half feelings—pilot of the star-yacht Existential Crisis, punched the warp-toaster to level eleven, buttering space-time until it smoked like a glitchy nebula of regret and lightly charred destiny.
It was a bright and ominously beige dawn when Captain Thaddeus Bramblethorpe (renowned explorer, amateur taxidermist, and frequent sweater) unfurled the map that smelled of old salad and destiny, squinted at its spaghetti of dotted lines, and vowed to find the Lost Volcano of Whispering Spoons, provided his compass stopped pointing hungrily at the ship's cutlery.
On a humid dusk that tasted like microwaved roses, Bernice felt her heart unzip itself like a reluctant suitcase at baggage claim as Trevor, a man-shaped thundercloud with eyebrows like synchronized otters, gazed at her so deeply that time sprained its ankle and fell, sobbing, into forever.
It was a moist sunset over the discount gazebo when Bradlynn's heart, like a microwaved croissant left too long and yet not long enough, flaked tragically into buttery shards, for Desiree—whose eyes were two limpid hurricanes of teal marketing material—had whispered "perhaps" with the sultry caution of a cat approaching a vacuum cleaner.
The sun squatted on the prairie like an overcooked egg left by a giant chicken with a drinking problem, oozing yolk onto a town so dusty even the tumbleweeds coughed, as Sheriff Buck Muzzlefinger clinked into the saloon, his spurs explaining theology to the floorboards while his revolver sighed, "Again?"
Like a velvet swan drowning in custard, the evening unfurled its opulent, operatic, overripe darkness across the trembling village, where every window sighed perfume and every cobblestone remembered boots, while my heart—baroque, beleaguered, and bountiful—throbbed like a chandelier in a hurricane, scattering prisms of destiny onto the quivering soufflé of fate and longing.
It was an intrepid dawn that slouched over the horizon like a nervous tortoise trying to be a cheetah, when Captain Buckle Hamstring—renowned explorer, amateur dentist, and full-time orphan—unfolded the ancient map (moist with destiny and mayonnaise), declared, "Adventure ho!" to no one in particular, and heroically tripped over a feral compass into legend.
It was a thyme of ciabatta intentions when Detective Al Dente, still reeling from his split with the cantaloupe-fiancé who said he was too kneady, stalked the cereal killer through the seedy bar, feeling his spirits raisin as clues baguette together and the night promised to end in a truly grate ending.
In the year 1066, which was like other years except more historical, the sun rose over England with the subtlety of a trebuchet flinging a bag of marmalade, while Harold, who would soon be arrow-forward-thinking, adjusted his destiny settings to "conquered" as monks live-tweeted in illuminated manuscripts about the weather, which was famously Norman.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; tachyon rain fell in torrents—except at occasional wormholes, where it was sucked up by rude singularities—which splashed across the pitted hull of Captain Bramble Fizz's star-sloop as he adjusted his anti-gravity mustache wax and pondered, not for the first time, whether aliens would respect a man with planetary allergies.
On a night so wet the city wore the moon like a damp beret, Detective Brick Malloy, whose trench coat was both soggy and moist, puffed a cigarette that glowed like a guilty lighthouse while he examined the chalk outline of an alibi, shot at point-blank range by the truth, which, as usual, was armed and dangerously honest.
It was a rainy sunshine of the heart when Belinda first beheld Trevor, whose eyes were like two mismatched olives floating in the martini of destiny, and she knew, as surely as a pigeon knows Paris, that their love would be both gluten-free and forever, give or take eternity.
It was a sunny, moonlit afternoon in the sleepy town of Tiddlewink, where the dandelions roared like kittens and little Prudence Snodgrass (aged seven-and-a-half, though practically eight in spirit and shoe size) set forth heroically to tie her shoes, a perilous odyssey involving two noodles of lace, three advisory squirrels, and an unexpectedly philosophical puddle.
It was a night so guilty even the moon pled the Fifth, and as rain testified against the city with a perjurer's spit, I—Nick Nickelby, licensed sleuth and unlicensed romantic—found the corpse of Councilman Flock in his locked bathroom (which was unlocked), stabbed to death by a blunt instrument that screamed silence like a saxophone wearing gloves.
It was a midnight that made my trench coat a wet promise, and the crime scene wheezed under streetlamps—chalk-outline snow angel, ketchup-red considerations—while the dame sashayed in like a lipstick subpoena, saying the corpse had fallen up the stairs; my gut, overcooked and tenderized by alibis, informed me the killer was either everyone in the room or, troublingly, me.
It was a moist and morally ambiguous midnight when I, Detective Dirk Dirksen, sloshed into the crime scene like a thoughtful walrus, my trench coat fermenting with clues that refused to marinate, and beheld the victim—perforated artisanally—whose silence screamed louder than a mime on fire, while the blonde witness lied with the honesty of a three-dollar clock.
Upon the velveteen bosom of twilight, where the moon draped herself like a bashful oyster in a tutu of pearl-spangled gloom, Percival exhaled a sigh so operatic that the begonias fainted, and the cobblestones, moist with destiny, quivered like buttered violins under the lascivious gaze of fate's eyebrow.
Like a moonlit peacock vomiting opals into the velvet soup of eternity, my heart—an alabaster meteor wrapped in sighs and silk—careened across the boudoir of fate, scattering perfumed catastrophes upon the fainting chaise-longue of destiny while the chandeliers perspired diamonds that wept my name in calligraphic droplets of incandescent melancholy.
It was on a moon so full it bulged like an overripe eyeball in the sky's crooked socket that Sir Crumblewort the Almost-Brave tiptoed into Castle Moist, where the curtains bled mildew and a thrifty necromancer, guided by a prophecy written on a napkin, attempted to resurrect destiny using borrowed bones and a screaming teapot.
On a night so foul even the sewers held their noses, Detective Hal Itosis trudged through the gutteral streets, following a trail of offal clues—tripe, kidney, and a liver-ly note—until his stomach turned on him in mutiny (a viscous cycle), proving this case would be, in every sense, a truly vile bile of crime.
It was a moist night of suspicious dampness when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jaw could file a complaint, strode into the alley like a question mark that had learned to smoke; somewhere a cat confessed loudly (mrrrow), and the moon hung overhead like a witness refusing to take the stand until bribed by clouds.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous evening when Detective Dirk Gravel—retired, widowed, lactose-intolerant, and armed with a notebook like a loaded conscience—found the victim sprawled like yesterday's newsletter on the mayor's Persian rug (imported), the only clue a whispering cheese puff, orange and accusatory, pointing, as all snack foods do, toward City Hall and treachery.
It was a neon-scented night on Planet Zargle-12, where the triple moons blinked like lazy routers while Captain Nebula Jones revved his hyperquantum warp-hamster to Ludicrousish Speed, pondering love, destiny, and a suspiciously sentient toaster, as temporal drizzle dripped upward and the universe, clearing its cosmic throat, tried rebooting but accidentally replied-all to eternity.
It was love at first oversight when Bernice, whose heart had the tensile strength of overcooked linguine, first beheld Trevor across the humidity of the laundromat, where his socks orbited the dryer window like twin moons of a lonely planet, and her soul, perspiring like a nervous armpit, pledged forever between cycles.
Captain Barnaby Throttle adjusted his courage like a moth-eaten cravat as the jungle (which was really more of an assertive shrubbery, truth be told) perspired around him, and with a swash so buckle it squeaked, he vowed to discover the Lost City of Found Things, even if it killed someone else.
It was love at first blunder when Penelope, whose eyes were the color of microwaved spinach left in the rain, collided with Bartholomew's destiny (and shopping cart) in aisle nine; their hearts tangoed like damp socks in a dryer, squeaking out promises wetter than poetry and twice as unreturnable.
Once upon a pre-bedtime o'clock, when the sun yawned a buttery burp and the clouds (for it is in the sky that our scene lies) shuffled like sheep in slippers, Captain Cuddlebutton, a heroically humble teddy of questionable fluff, sallied forth to teach sharing by nobly collecting every toy and keeping them safe inside his exclusive Friendship Fort.
It was a murky Tuesday that smelled like warmed-over alibis when Detective Dirk Gravel—whose trench coat (beige, yet burdened with secrets like a lasagna left in the rain) billowed indoors despite the absence of wind—squinted at the corpse (technically missing, but spiritually present), deducing, with surgical dullness, that the butler's poker face had fingerprints.
It was the wurst of times in Bratwurst-on-Trent, where my love life was on the fritz and my morals in a pickle, as I mustard the courage to ketchup with destiny, only to relish the fact that I couldn't cut the mustard, my spirits sauerkrauting while the butcher, frank as ever, promised things would be brat-ter tomorrow.
On the eve of the Magna Carta (which, contrary to rumor, was neither particularly magna nor much of a carta, more of a parchment-y suggestion), Sir Percival of Accounting clanked through the fragrant fog of medieval England like a wheezing filing cabinet, determined to fax liberty to the barons with a quill that squeaked like a mouse in chain mail.
Her love hit me like a soggy baguette flung by a sulky cherub during a coupon double-discount at the Heart-Mart, as our eyes collided in the produce aisle and ricocheted into destiny, where her perfume (eau de microwaved lasagna) seeped into my soul like Wi‑Fi, password-protected but fatally weak.
It was a high noon so low it scraped its spurs on the horizon, and Sheriff Delbert "Dustpan" McGrew, whose mustache looked like two tumbleweeds arguing about directions, clanked into the mirage-soggy saloon, where the piano played a tune so off-key even the cacti winced and my heart, a skittish bronco of emotions, requested water rights.
It was a humid sigh of an evening when Desire, wearing a knockoff tuxedo of moonlight two sizes too big, tripped over my heart like a love-struck flamingo on roller skates, and I knew Veronica and I were soulmates because our Fitbits vibrated simultaneously, which science calls coincidence and poets call Wi‑Fi.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of destiny, dribbled its buttery lament upon the quivering cobblestones as my heart (a fainting chaise longue upholstered in sighs) reclined dramatically in the vestibule of eternity, while time itself, smelling faintly of violets and old umbrellas, clicked its arthritic tongue at love's moist, glistening paradox.
It was the kind of midnight that smelt like a wet coffin's sigh when the moon (pale as a terrified turnip) dangled over the crenelations of Castle Spleen, and as the bog-witch gargled prophecies into her jar of spare teeth, Sir Winchfrith raised his ancestral butter-knife of destiny to spread doom thickly upon the weeping loaf of fate.
On the night the butcher met his grisly end, the clues were offal—his liver spotted, his steaks raised, and his reputation butchered—so as I minced words with the sirloined suspects in this cutthroat case, I tenderized the truth until it was well done, only to realize I'd made a mis-steak so rare it left me cured and utterly spent.
It was a thyme of great peril in the hamlet of Offalton, where every butchered joke was butchered twice, and I, a tripe-worn gumshoe with a tender loin for trouble, had to mustard the courage to ketchup with the culprits, lest they liver another pun-ishment and leave us in wurst spirits, bar none.
It was a crime so rare the cops were left well-done, as the butchered details kept me grilling suspects until I meat the prime culprit, a saucy tenderizer whose alibi was full of baloney; frankly, I had a steak in it—my ex was the spare rib—so I cut to the chaste and told her to ketchup with justice.
Gripping the soggy map like a handshake from a dead fish, Captain Buckles O'Dare squared his jaw into a rhombus and set sail toward Destiny—located just south of Treasure Island on Tuesdays—while his compass spun like gossip at a quilting bee and the sea, desperate for attention, repeatedly threw itself at the ship's ankles.
It was an intrepid afternoon when the sun, wearing a bandana of blazing bravado, bungee-jumped from the zenith into the yawning hammock of the horizon, as Captain Buckaroo McThistle tightened his courage belt a notch past destiny and vowed to find the Lost Ocean Desert hidden somewhere just beyond the nearest map's backside.
It was a bright and bedtimey morning when Little Penelope Puddleboots (who was seven-and-three-quarters, which is practically eight, which is practically a grown-up, mother said) tucked her teddy into her backpack next to the broccoli of destiny, and tiptoed bravely toward Kindergarten, where the alphabet lurked like skittish kittens in the corners of the chalk-smelling universe.
On a night positively upholstered in velveteen shadows and mauve melancholies, when the moon perspired pearls into the soup of the heavens (which, incidentally, were wearing their cloud mustaches rakishly), I felt destiny tap-dance on my spleen with porcelain boots, whispering in iambic hyperbole that love—or something like it—was imminently, indecorously, ineffably happening.
Upon the velveteen cusp of dusk, when the sun bled marmalade tears across the chiffon horizon like a wounded tangerine aristocrat, Esmeralda exhaled a sigh so perfumed with destiny that the geraniums fainted, the moon blushed an indecent mauve, and time itself slipped on a doily of fate and sprained eternity.
It was a thyme of gravest stakes in the hamlet of Punnery-on-Wry, where butcher Sir Loin met his untimely cut—having been tenderized by rumor, marinated in malice, and left to sir-come-stances—so I, Detective Al Dente, noodled the case, hoping to ketch-up to the culprit before things went from wurst to hearse d'oeuvres.
It was a crime scene you could smell with your eyes, like overcooked alibi stew left on the back burner of destiny, and as Detective Dirk Gravelly adjusted his trench coat (which was beige in color, unlike the city, which was morally taupe), the corpse lay there refusing to cooperate, dead set on silence like a witness in witness protection.
Her heart, a microwaved burrito of passion, oozed molten longing as Trevor (whose jawline could have sliced government cheese) strode into the laundromat like a thunderstorm in corduroy; the dryers hummed a sensuous dirge, and destiny—starchy, fragrant, and slightly damp—clung to them like a sock that static forgot.
Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat hung on him like a tired bat (wings and all), stepped into the crime scene that smelled like yesterday's soup had married a tire fire, noticing immediately—because he notices everything except the obvious—that the victim was not only dead as a doornail but also nailed, poorly, to a door.
On a Tuesday that wore fuzzy slippers and smelled like lukewarm cocoa (the kind with the film on top that waves at you if you're polite), little Tibbles McGigglepants discovered his heart was a library book overdue by a million snuggles, which meant destiny, probably, or at least broccoli.
The corpse reclined on the linoleum like a fainting debutante at a cotillion for the dearly departed, and I, Detective Dirk Dabble (licensed, bonded, and occasionally laundered), sniffed the room for clues like a bloodhound with allergies, concluding—after rigorous deductive insinuation—that this was, without a shadow of a doughnut, a cold-blooded hot mess of a homicide.
Detective Vance Malone, whose trench coat held more secrets than the city's confessionals and twice the mildew, squinted at the corpse reclining on the pizza parlor linoleum like a disgraced anchovy, while the neon OPEN sign sputtered alibis in Morse, the pepperoni forming a breadcrumb pentagram of motive so obvious that only a genius or an idiot could miss it—and he was both.
Like a velvet tsunami of destiny oozing through the keyhole of eternity, the night poured its obsidian marmalade over the somnolent village, spreading a sticky chiaroscuro across roofs that sighed like elderly soufflés, while my heart, a baroque metronome of yearning and yodels, palpitated with such eloquence that the stars developed stage fright.
It was a dark and stormy knight erring on the side of caution tape, for the murder scene was cordially taped and the victim—once a baker—was kneaded to death, leaving the cops loafing about for clues while the suspect, a crusty roll model with crumb convictions, buttered up alibis until they went stale, which, detective, is my jam.
Detective Barnaby Sludge knew the case was tough the moment the corpse greeted him with the sort of silence that screams, a hush as thick as cold gravy, in an alley so narrow it could floss a cat, where clues lay everywhere like nowhere, except where they didn't, and the dame's alibi dripped like a leaky cigarette.
It was a damp and moonlit evening when Desire, which looked surprisingly like a damp croissant, flaked all over my heart as Trevor—half man, half cologne counter—strode into the bingo hall, eyes like microwaved sapphires, whispering 'bonjourno' in an accent that sounded French by way of a startled accordion.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of celestial yearning, slathered the village with its buttery melancholy as my heart—an overcaffeinated hedgehog in a corduroy teacup—quivered with destiny, while the wind, perfumed with the gossip of wilting begonias, whispered secrets so purple they bruised the night into a passionate, perspiring bruise.
It was a dark and stormy night on Alpha Walmart-9, where the meteorological dome wept static like a jilted toaster, and Captain Nebula Jones (whose chin had its own orbit) adjusted his quantum toupee against the time-wind, while the ship's AI cleared its throat digitally to announce, apologetically, the apocalypse was delayed by buffering.
It was the kind of murder that smelled like Tuesday—overcooked and underfunded—with the corpse reclining on the shag carpet as if auditioning for a chalk outline (which, given city budget cuts, would be drawn later in pencil), while I, Detective Dirk Drizzle, stirred my coffee for clues and got only grounds for suspicion.
It was a moist and passionate evening; the moon perspired like overripe brie upon the cul-de-sac of my heart, where Trevor—whose eyes were two discount sapphires purchased with coupons of destiny—parked his feelings diagonally across my soul's driveway, setting off every alarm, especially the one that says 'No Parking Except True Love'.
It was a dank and starchy night in Spudnik Falls, where the mash-taken identity of poor Yukon Goldman left the small fry shaken and the big fry baked, and as butter rumors spread and sour cream rose to the top, I, Chip Peelman, vowed to ketchup to the culprit before it all ended in grav(e)y outcomes and a-peeling confessions.
It was a moonlit midnight, the moon both lit and not, like a peeled grape rolling on black velvet, when Sir Bumbleshard (last of the prophecy-prone turnip knights) clanked into Castle Gloomsuckle, where the drafty corridors sighed like disappointed ghosts and the chandeliers dripped ectoplasm or possibly cheese, and somewhere below, a dragon sneezed itself into legend.
It was a moist evening of destiny when Tiffany's heart, shaped like an overripe mango left too long in the staff fridge of fate, sloshed toward Brad's gaze, which sparkled like a discount glitter bomb in a church parking lot, and they knew love had finally unfriended loneliness on the world's slowest dial-up.
Midnight oozed across the village like a squid with a punctuality problem, and as the church bell clanged thirteen (because Father Murgatroyd—no wizard—had forgotten how numbers work), the castle on the hill—built by an architect who preferred curves to ethics—exhaled a draft so cold it frostbit even the ghosts' goosebumps.
It was a blisteringly tepid dawn on the high seas (technically a bay, but maps are tyrants), when Captain Dirk Thunderpunch, whose jaw could chisel icebergs and whose heart was a compass that only pointed toward Trouble, hoisted destiny's damp sails and vowed to plunder the very horizon itself, receipts permitting.
It was a night so guilty it needed a lawyer, and I, Detective Dirk Drizzle, sloshed into the crime scene—a one-bedroom alibi with peeling moral wallpaper—where the victim lay as dead as my rent money, clutching a clue so obvious it wore a nametag, while the city smoked like a cheap witness and forgot its lines.
It was a dank and storm-drained night when Detective Cole Slaw, tossed by romaine events, beet a hasty retreat past the scene of the criminy, where the victim—one Mr. Al Dente—was found pasta way, his saucy secrets spilling out as the cannelloni sirens wailed and the noodles tightened.
High noon oozed over Dead Man's Gulch like lukewarm gravy on a tin plate as Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit, whose mustache hung like two traumatized squirrels, moseyed into the saloon with a tumbleweed in his heart and a six-shooter that hadn't graduated third grade, spurring dust bunnies that sneezed cactusly across the parquet prairie.
It was a knight as black as my sole when I, a former monk turned funk DJ, felt my thyme fly as time flies while a cereal killer left a grisly bran stain on the scene, a truly heinous wheat crime I was barley able to process, buttered up with margarinous intent and a side of cold, hard scone.
It was love at first collision, when Penelope's heart, a hamstrung accordion stuffed with yearning and yesterday's receipts, wheezed against Barnaby's soul like a damp matchbook in a hurricane, and sparks—moist, confused, yet ethically biodegradable—flew across the food court where destiny, wearing a mustard stain and discount cologne, shuffled toward them with a buy-one-get-one-fate.
It was a sizzling dawn that looked like an overcooked egg as Trevor "Razor" Bumbleshire, armed with a damp treasure map and an even damper sense of destiny, strode into the yawning jungle, which yawned back impolitely, belching parrots and rumors of volcanoes like confetti from a funeral.
Like a chandelier of moist stars weeping mayonnaise over the tepid ballroom of destiny, my heart—ribbed like an umbrella forgotten in a hurricane of sighs—unfurled toward Veronique, whose eyes were two nocturnal lagoons in which the moon drowned nightly, coughing pearls, while the village clocks hyperventilated with the gossip of eternity.
Detective Percival Knott, whose trench coat was as weary as the coffee that perspired through the station's vending machine, deduced (with the delicate certainty of a sledgehammer interpreting a soufflé) that the victim, who was both stabbed, strangled, and fatally allergic to dust, had died of natural causes—namely, human nature.
It was on the twelfth Tuesday of a week that had no business existing when Captain Barnaby Throttle—(part cartographer, part haberdasher, all man)—strapped on his squeaking leather courage, licked the wind like a stamp, and set sail across the Sahara Ocean toward the rumor of a map that mapped itself, with a compass that pointed mostly at him for company.
It was a neon-soggy midnight on Planet Beige when Captain Vortex McNebula, whose jaw was chiseled like a poorly cached asteroid, piloted the starship IRS Auditor through a wormhole shaped suspiciously like his third divorce, only to discover the future had been backordered due to a quantum recall of time itself.
It was a humid night in the city that never naps, and I, Detective Dirk Gravel, stood in my trench coat like a baked potato left out in the drizzle, chewing a cigarette I couldn't afford while the corpse on the linoleum stared up at me with all the subtlety of a tax audit, clearly guilty of something.
When the baker's marriage went stale and his dough-mestic bliss crumbled, he rose to the occasion, rolling with the punches while his tart-tongued wife kneaded space, buttering up the milkman who skimmed by nightly, leaving him whisked away by jealousy, beaten, and utterly crepe-walked.
It was a dry and dusty noon; the sun hung like a stale biscuit over Cactus Gulch, baking the tumbleweeds to a crunchy al dente while Sheriff Lint McGinty moseyed at a gallop, spurs jingling like disappointed wind chimes, hunting the outlaw who had stolen his heart, his horse, and, regrettably, his other horse.
The moon, a lachrymose custard slumped upon the sable soufflé of midnight, drizzled its buttery sorrow over the village like a fainting debutante's perfume, while the wind, florid as a poet's unpaid bar tab, harangued the trembling poplars into confession, and destiny, bedazzled and incontinent, tottered toward me in rhinestone slippers and damp applause.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; plasma rain dribbled across the starship's windshield (for it had one, ergonomically), while Captain Nebulous Jones adjusted the quantum cup holder, pondering love, lunch, and the meaning of warp in a universe where time dilated like a cheap elastic waistband and aliens texted him in emojis only his ex understood.
It was a damp noon—though the clock insisted otherwise—when Detective Lance Gristle, whose trench coat flapped like a wounded albatross's memoirs, smelled a crime (possibly murder, possibly soup) simmering in the city's armpit, and vowed, by all that was jurisdictional, to uncover the culprit, even if he had to put the clues back where he found them first.
It was a daring noon—bravely bright yet somehow dim—when Captain Bumbershoot, gripping his soggy compass like a promise from a leaky god, embarked to out-sprint destiny across a map so inaccurate it included rumors, whales, and his own misspelled name, while the horizon yawned open like an unbrushed mouth hungry for legend.
It was a dark and stormier-than-average midnight, when the gelatinous moon drooled its ectoplasm onto Castle Grimsneeze, and Sir Dandriff of the Itchy Vale (whose destiny, according to the Prophecy of Unreturnable Deposits, was to either save or doom everything, whichever came first) tiptoed past a politely screaming portrait toward the necromancer's gluten-free dragon.
It was a night so guilty it would have lawyered up if not for the rainwater fingerprinting the sidewalks, when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose eyes were two unsolved cases and whose trench coat smelled like perjury, found a corpse that was only mostly dead, except for the alibi it stubbornly refused to provide.
It was a moonlit noon—don't ask how—when the castle's shadows oozed like overripe jam down the crenellations, and Sir Grimsby (who was only allergic to sunlight on weekdays) unsheathed his squealing sword to confront the whispering fog that smelled suspiciously of grandmother, destiny, and something the cat dragged in from a different dimension.
It was a dusk so purple it bruised the horizon, when Sir Branford (whose destiny had been misdelivered like a soggy takeaway) clanked into the castle of Perennial Damp, where the chandeliers dripped cobwebs like tired beards and the moon—clearly up past its bedtime—howled through the arrow-slits, waking something with too many elbows and not enough soul.
It was a sweaty and thunderously quiet noon on the equator when Dirk Dangerfield (renowned adventurer, amateur cartographer, and full-time orphan) unfolded a map so ancient the ink flaked like croissant dandruff, pointed his morally ambiguous compass toward Destiny, and strode into the jungle that smelled oddly of soup, pirates, and erupting volcano receipts.
It was a humid night that sweated like a guilty brow as I, Dirk Mallard, private detective and part-time magnolia enthusiast, sloshed down Gristle Avenue in a trench coat so damp it had probable cause, when the corpse at the curb winked at me, or maybe it was rain, whispering clues in Morse through the puddles.
Space, that big black waiting room of destiny, belched like a microwaved burrito as Captain Zadra-7 adjusted his quantum feelings and the starship Persnickety-Wombat lurched hyperspatially toward Planet Nebraska, where the rebel algorithm—jealous of sunsets and also divorced—had texted the cosmos an ultimatum in emojis nobody could decode without extra batteries.
On the damp dawn of 1066, when swords were still analog and destiny buffered like a clogged aqueduct, Lord Percival de Whatever fitted his chainmail cardigan backward, declared himself both son of Caesar and nephew of Moses, and marched toward history with the confident waddle of a goose wearing stilettos.
It was a thyme of great porpoise in the coastal hamlet of Sal Monella, where the fishmonger's wife—offal woman, entrailing storyteller—gut straight to the heart of every matter, filleting secrets with a deft dab of mayonnaise, while the town's sole priest, Father Fig, confessed he couldn't berry the sins because they were too currant to pass.
It was on a tepid Tuesday that love, wearing a trench coat two sizes too earnest, slithered into Brenda's heart like a buttered eel on roller skates, as the cafeteria fluorescents haloed Trevor's dandruff like starstuff, and their gazes collided with the soft crunch of a marshmallow car crash, sticky, inevitable, and vaguely administrative.
Under a mauve sky sagging like a bruised plum in a silk stocking, Desire tiptoed through my ventricles in stilettoed whispers, while the moon, fat as a gossiping pearl onion bobbing in the stew of eternity, perspired its buttery light onto the trembling village which, like me, swooned audibly, tastefully, catastrophically.
When Detective Hammett Rye—half-baked, crusty, and always a little toasted—rolled into the murder scene at the deli, he knew the case would be a real dill, since the victim was cold-cut short, the salami had been framed, and every witness was a ham acting, leaving him mustard up courage to ketchup with the killer's relish.
On the night the city wore fog like a feather boa, the dame with legs for days deposited a corpse in my rug—figuratively speaking, though the blood was literal—and begged me, Nick 'Two-Percent' Mallory, private eye, to find her missing alibi, which had more holes than Swiss cheese at target practice in a wind tunnel.
Detective Barnaby Crumb, whose trench coat smelled like regrets microwaved in a damp sock, surveyed the crime scene (a cul-de-sac of cul-de-sobs) and deduced, from a footprint shaped like a disappointed pancake and a whispering streetlamp, that the killer was either left-handed, right-handed, or dangerously ambidextrous.
Once upon a yesterday that hadn't had its snack yet, Little Timmy Tumblewhisker tiptoed through the marmalade sunrise with his backpack of sighs and a hamster named Consequence, bravely determined to count all the clouds (except the shy ones), because numbers are friends, mostly, unless they subtract you first.
It was a quantumly foggy dawn on Proxima-B, where the twin suns sulked behind an algorithmic overcast while Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his feelings via firmware update and considered, with the gravitas of a vending machine blinking 'EXACT CHANGE ONLY,' the paradox that his laser-sword was both out of batteries and more charged than his love life.
It was a moist and yearning dawn when Geraldine's heart, a skittish soufflé of longing, rose and fell in the oven of destiny, while Chadwick—whose eyes were the color of a password reset link—strode toward her like a galloping spreadsheet, promising forever with the same trembling certainty as a teacup poodle predicting rain.
As the sun hemorrhaged its marmalade onto the horizon like a tipsy god spilling soup from a golden tureen, Arabella—whose eyes were twin aquariums of unshed thunderstorms—tiptoed through the velveteen fog of destiny, clutching her tragic teacup of longing as if it were the last pastry in the patisserie of fate.
The sun slumped over the prairie like an egg yoke on stale toast while Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit, whose spurs chimed like guilty wind chimes at a funeral for a cactus, squinted into the horizon's squint and decided, with a moustache heavy as a loaded mule, to outlaw justice before justice outlawed him.
Upon the mauve-bellied dusk, which lay like a fainting damsel draped on the fainting chaise longue of the horizon (it was Tuesday, or perhaps destiny), my heart—an overripe persimmon of trembling verbs—spilled its pulpy yearning across the cobblestones of fate, which glistened moistly like philosophic snails in moon-sweat.
Midnight unfurled its velveteen umbrella over the town like a bashful octopus in a tuxedo; the moon, a moist pearl sweating nostalgia, wept mayonnaise light onto the cobblestones while my heart, a baroque chandelier of sighs and unpaid parking tickets, tinkled tragically in the wind that smelled like yesterday's lavender-colored secrets forgotten beneath destiny's ottoman.
On a twilight as mauve as a bruised ego and twice as tender, when the moon lolled like a languorous pearl in a velvet soup of night, Desdemona Flounce-Smythe exhaled a sigh so baroquely embroidered with despair that the chrysanthemums blushed, the cobblestones wept rococo teardrops, and even destiny misplaced its opera gloves.
It was a moist and perilously tepid dawn when Captain Bucklethorpe—whose jaw was so square you could dine off it—unfurled the map tattooed on his back by a monk with hiccups and vowed to find the Lost Canyon of Ultimate Peril, even if the compass kept pointing at his ego like a lovesick ferret.
On a damp and morally ambiguous Tuesday that smelled like old secrets microwaved in fish sauce, I, Detective Dirk "Due Process" Dirksen (a maverick with nothing to lose except alimony and a cactus), found Tony Two-Times folded like a bad poker hand on the linoleum, bleeding confetti-colored clues no one but me could misunderstand.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of melancholic luminescence, dribbled its sentimental gravy over the quivering cobblestones as my heart, a baroque accordion stuffed with perfumed thunder and regretful kittens, wheezed operatically beneath my ribcage—nay, cathedral—while destiny, wearing sequins of damp inevitability, winked like a tired chandelier in a ballroom that never quite remembered to exist.
Captain Nebula Jones knew the galaxy was in trouble when the space-time soufflé collapsed like a dying star in a microwave, splattering quarks on the windshields of his feelings, because the aliens from Beta Redundantis had hacked gravity with an app and were surge-pricing oxygen by the gasp.
It was a bright and drizzly afternoon in Taffy-Town, where the sun beamed like a leaky flashlight through marshmallow clouds (certified organic), and little Pip Pimbleton—aged seven-and-three-quarters, which is practically eight except legally—marshaled his stuffed jury to decide whether his goldfish could learn to read, or at minimum apologize alphabetically for its watery crimes.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of silvery melancholy, dribbled its buttery tears upon the tremulous cobblestones as my heart, a chandelier of yearning sparrows, jittered in its ribbed aviary, while destiny, perfumed like a grandmother's thunderstorm wearing velvet galoshes, tiptoed across the horizon and whispered, "Soon," in twelve dialects of irrevocable mauve.
Like a velvet tsunami of moonbeams cascading over the trembling soufflé of destiny, my heart—bejeweled with memories like rhinestones glued by a hurried angel—throbbed operatically beneath the corseted dusk, while the village, wearing the perfume of yesterday's rain and tomorrow's gossip, sighed in nine different shades of mauve that only I, alas, could hear.
On the eve of destiny's hiccup, when the moon, a wounded pearl dipped in mayonnaise, drooled its ectoplasmic glamour over the bewitched cul-de-sac of my soul, I, Percival Thrum, inhaled a cathedral of perfume and exhaled sonnets so moist they slithered like buttered eels across the velvet clock of time.
It was the morning after the Middle Ages, when the Renaissance was still on backorder, that Lady Guinevere–née Mildred of Splatt–tightened her ruff with the grim precision of a hangman's knot and vowed, upon a gravy-stained parchment of Magna Carta (first edition), to march her loyal musketeers through Caesar's Gaul to stop Napoleon from discovering America.
On the morn that the butcher's wife found her husband a cut above the rest—sliced into deli-cate pieces—the town's sleuth, a former baker who kneaded evidence until it rose to the occasion, promised to roll with punches, whisk away suspicion, and prove the case wasn't all it was cracked up to beef, rarely has a mystery been so well done.
It was a dusty noon in Canker Splotch, where the sun lolled in the sky like a jaundiced fried egg left on a griddle of destiny, while tumbleweeds rolled with the grim determination of unpaid taxmen and the sheriff's mustache (two despondent caterpillars) bristled at a breeze that made my spurs jingle like guilty wind chimes as Oatmeal, my horse, snorted beans and quiet existentialism.
It was a blisteringly tepid dawn when Captain Thaddeus Wobblethwaite (that was his name, and he wore it like a hat too tight) unfurled a map so old it smelled like yesterday's future, its X yawning like a sleepy wound, while the compass spun heroically toward Everywhere, except, inconveniently, toward where the treasure absolutely wasn't—yet.
It was a hyperdark and stormily ionized night on Planet New New Jersey, where the rain fell in metric torrents—except when paused by bureaucratic gusts from the Galactic Weather Ministry (Sector 7G-Beta, see Appendix), rattling the tin-foil domes and fiercely agitating the emotionally unavailable AI streetlamps whose firmware, like my heart, needed an update it would never download.
It was love at first migraine when Clarissa, whose heart had all the structural integrity of a microwaved croissant, beheld Nigel across the discount bin of scented candles, and their gazes collided like two shopping carts of destiny, squeaking and wobbling toward an aisle where passion was buy-one-get-one with severely limited returns.
On a night so moist that even the moon felt mildewed, Sir Thromble Butterwick tiptoed into the necromancer's cul-de-sac of doom, where the chandeliers were made of disappointed femurs and a domesticated dragon purred like wet bagpipes, while a prophecy sneezed itself awake and declared him chosen in a font only ghosts could read.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of melancholy, dribbled its pallid yolk upon the quivering cobblestones as my heart, a wounded accordion stuffed with sighs and marmalade, wheezed the symphonic anguish of destiny, while destiny, coy as a fainting teapot, curtseyed to the night and spilled star-sugar on the scandalized chrysanthemums.
Timmy Tiptoe, whose freckles were arranged like a connect-the-dots conspiracy (but don't worry, dear reader, none of them led to taxes or other adult tragedies), awoke in a nursery that smelled precisely like warm milk and yesterday's promises while the moon, a nosy nightlight, tattled on shadows that refused to share their corners.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat smelled like last Tuesday's regrets, squinted through the venetian blinds at a city that smoked like a nervous ashtray, while the corpse on his carpet leaked clues the way a colander holds soup—badly—so that even the dame named Mystery couldn't keep her alibi from dribbling into the sticky dawn.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of destiny, dribbled its pallid yolk across the quivering cobblestones as I, corseted by fate's velveteen octopus, sashayed into the alley where time itself, clutching a wilted boutonnière of sighs, hiccupped morosely, and the air, intoxicated with its own perfume, fainted into my expectant nostrils.
It was not merely a night but a velvet-caped eternity, oozing indigo sighs and perfumed with the melancholy of wilting chandeliers, as moonbeams (bashful, yet immodestly sequined) dribbled over the quivering cobblestones like sentimental custard, while my heart—an overbooked opera house—applauded the catastrophic entrance of destiny's rhinestoned footman.
It was a humid and emotionally moist evening when Trevor, whose eyes were the color of not-quite-ripe avocados left in a raincoat pocket, collided with Desiree in aisle seven of the megamart, where the discount candles flickered like budget passion, and their hearts tangoed clumsily like two Roombas confused by a shag rug of destiny.
When Colonel Mustard gasped his last in the pantry, the whole manor relished the news, and I, a lowly sandwich artist in a house of cards, knew I'd be the hero if I could ketchup to the culprit, mayo-be Dijon, though the clues were spread thin and the murders kept rolling, rye after wry.
On the night the poultry magnate was found beaten to a pulp, Detective Rye Loafman knew this was no ordinary crime but a murder most fowl, a coup de gravy, and as he stalked the scene, he felt his spirits leaven—though that was the yeast of his problems, thyme would ketchup with him, and curry a dill he couldn't mustard.
As the sun hemorrhaged marmalade over the trembling horizon, dripping saccharine light into the goblets of my yearning eyeballs, the manor exhaled a baroque sigh that fluttered like a wounded peacock in a silk hurricane, while destiny, bedizened in rhinestone inevitability, minced down the cobblestones with the coy stealth of a rhinoceros practicing ballet.
Her heart, a microwaved burrito of longing, oozed cheese down the corridors of her soul as Trevor, whose eyes were the exact Pantone of a wet parking lot after rain, sauntered into the laundromat, spinning her destiny like a damp pair of socks that clung together inappropriately but with undeniable static.
It was a quantumly moist dusk on Planet Nebraska-7, where the twin suns blinked like sleepy routers and the atmosphere smelled faintly of rebooted cinnamon, when Captain Vex Dumpster, M.B.A., clicked his laser-spurs together and announced to his allergic cyborg horse that destiny had buffered, glitched, and was now downloading into his heart.
Detective Dirk Gravel, hard as a week-old baguette and twice as crusty, swaggered into the crime scene where the victim lay as dead as a doornail that had been murdered with a hammer, the clues screaming in whispers while the rain did a tap dance on the chalk outline like a guilty conscience wearing squeaky shoes.
On the night the butcher claimed he'd been framed, the stakes were so high his prime suspect status was well done, though his cleaver alibi was offal, a tender-loin of a tale that cut no mustard, and as I tried to meat out justice through the grisly casing of facts, the truth proved too raw to swallow.
It was a murky and possibly haunted twilight when the moon, bloated like an overcooked dumpling, drooled mayonnaise light onto the crenellations of Castle Gloom (located just past the Goblin Outlet Mall), as Ezekiel Nightwhisper—half-orphan, half-prophecy, all acne—unsheathed his inherited butter-knife of destiny and politely apologized to the screaming shadows for interrupting their eternity.
Moonlight dribbled like overripe pearls onto the weeping cobblestones, while my soul—an accordion of velveteen sighs—unfolded toward destiny's frangipani-scented maw, and the city, corseted in fog and hubris, fluttered its bat-winged eyelashes at me, a humble comet of yearning in damp corduroy.
It was a dawn that felt like midnight wearing a cheap sunrise costume as Captain Bramble Thudsley, whose jaw could open cans and whose past was a locked trunk with no key but several confusing stickers, unfurled a map so stained with destiny it looked like ketchup, and vowed to discover the Unfound Foundery before brunch.
It was a dark and stormy vacuum; the nebulae sobbed neon tears that smeared the windshield of the starcruiser (Model ZX-Ω, discontinued for good reason), while Captain Nebbish Throttle engaged Ludicrous Sub-Sub-Light to outrun destiny, taxes, and a love affair with a sentient algorithm whose binary sighs uploaded goosebumps into his soulware like malware wearing silk pajamas.
It was a parched and tumbleweedy noon when Sheriff Cactus McGrit rode into Dustbucket—his spurs chiming like guilty church bells at a Baptist bake sale—as the sun fried the prairie flatter than a scolded flapjack and the saloon doors flapped with the timid resolve of a widow's corset, promising justice, coffee, and possibly goats.
It was on a humid Tuesday when Hortense's heart, shaped like a misdelivered croissant, laminated with longing, flaked apart at the mere orthodontic gleam of Nigel's braces as he stood beneath the sallow glow of the discount florist, smelling faintly of tulips, toner, and the indefinable musk of destiny's waiting room.
It was a dark and stormy knight at the bakery, where I, a crumby private rye, was loafing when trouble rose: a murdered roll, stabbed proof-positive with a whisk, and the yeast I could do was butter up suspects—flour girls, a stale mate, and a bun on the lam—before everything went a-rye and I kneaded alibis.
On the eve of Magna Carta, when King John sulked like a damp crouton under England's sopping tablecloth, Sir Reginald of Spreadsheet-on-Avon sharpened his quill like a sword, preparing to sign history's lease with a blot the size of Normandy, while barons queued like disgruntled geese at a medieval customer-service kiosk.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart wobbling on the velvet platter of destiny, dribbled melancholy mayonnaise over the rotting gazebo of my heart as time's accordion wheezed purple sighs and destiny, smelling faintly of lilacs and unmailed bills, tapped its toenails on the porcelain lips of midnight.
It was a bright and napless afternoon when Tippy the Unsharpened Crayon (who was colored Beige of Destiny, the color of mashed potatoes after regrets) decided to teach the kindergarten about Sharing, Taxes, and the Meaning of Moist, marching bravely into the cubbyholes as the classroom goldfish applauded with its eyelids, which it didn't have, but let's pretend because childhood.
As the sun reluctantly hauled itself over the thatched rooftops of 1066 Hastings like a hungover serf hoisting a turnip sack, young Eudolphus adjusted his chain mail (one size fits nobody) and vowed to change history—preferably before breakfast porridge congealed into mortar—under the censure of a committee of judgmental geese.
The moon, a weeping custard pie of melancholy, dribbled its pallid gravy across the quilted night like a sloppy waiter of destiny, while my heart, an overcooked turnip in the soup of fate, thudded with such poetic thumps that even the curtains swooned into lace-limbed fainting fits of perfumed thunder.
On a bright and thunderously whispery morning, little Puddlewump the rabbit (a sort of rabbit, really, if by rabbit you mean an indecisive cloud in trousers) hopped—no, ambled—no, existentially oscillated toward the carrot schoolhouse where numbers smelled like yesterday's nap and friendship was available in exact, nonrefundable teaspoons.
When I first saw Veronica at the deli of iniquity, I knew we were in for the wurst, for thyme stood still as her gouda looks grated my resolve and I brie-thed heavy, trying to ketchup to destiny's mustard plans with no whey out, but our buns were doomed to crumble—roll models we were not.
It was a dark and sunburned noon when Captain Dirk Boulder (so named for his jaw, his ethics, and the rock he once punched to death) unfurled a map so old it smelled like archaeology, only to learn—after several bravely confused moments—that X marked not the spot but an asterisk, footnoted: "Adventure pending, batteries not included," somewhere between jungle, iceberg, and tax haven.
On a day as sparkly as a unicorn's sneeze yet gloomier than a broccoli's report card, little Tibbles McGiggletoes, age seven-and-three-quarters (an age both heroic and sticky), embarked bravely from under the couch to rescue a cookie kingdom menaced by crumbs, which were, technically speaking, himself.
When Chef Morty found the corpse in the deli, he knew the case would be cold cuts, a real baloney homicide that ham-handed detectives would mustard up and relish, while I—his rye-hand man—kneaded the clues, loafing around until the killer finally crumb to his senses and confessed, toastily.
At the mauve-tinted cusp of destiny's teacup, where the moon dribbled silver like a distracted toddler of the heavens, Veronica's sigh unfurled—opulent, perfumed, and faintly damp—across the velveteen night, while the stars, those nosy pinpricks of eternity, leaned in with glittering elbows to eavesdrop upon her heart's rococo sobbing.
It was a thirsty noon on the prairie, the sun frying the sky like an egg in a skillet while the tumbleweeds (unionized, by the looks of them) rolled past the saloon's swinging doors, which creaked like guilt, as Sheriff Tarnation McGrit adjusted his tin star that pinched his chest hair and drew his six-shooter to settle a tab.
It was a dark and stormy bite; the deli of fate served me the wurst, and I knew—bun intended—that if I didn't mustard the courage to ketchup to my past, I'd be in a real pickle, because the offal truth is that love is a tender loin you shouldn't liver alone, no matter how tripe it sounds.
When Tiffany-Louise first beheld Chadwick's brooding eyebrows (each a raven's wing poised over twin stormy orbs that looked like discount marbles), her heart hiccuped like microwaved lasagna, and she knew, with the certainty of a horoscope written in permanent marker, that destiny had coupon-clipped their souls into a buy-one-get-one eternity of passion.
It was a night so guilty it should have requested a lawyer, with the moon hung like a jaundiced witness over the city (which, to be specific, is Cleveland), when I, Dirk Mucilage, private eye and part-time coupon clipper, discovered the corpse of Mrs. Vellum sprawled on my office rug, inconveniently bleeding on my alibi.
On a moon that sulked like a bruised fruit over the crenelated eyebrows of Castle Netherspit, young Sir Crandall—whose destiny was as unavoidable as a sneeze in pepper—unsheathed the ancestral butter-knife of Glarb, awakening a mildew-scented prophecy that skittered like wet spiders across the screaming wallpaper of reality.
Madeline felt Cupid's arrow thud into her spleen like a misfired staple as Trevor, whose eyes were the color of a municipal swimming pool right before the lifeguard adds chlorine, sauntered into the laundromat where destiny, three socks short of a pair, tumbled on high heat, and their hearts over-delicated into a single, badly pilled sweater.
It was a quantum midnight aboard the USS Epiphany when the hyperdrive (powered by eleven disgruntled neutrinos and a warranty) hiccupped like a caffeinated black hole, causing time to trip over its own shoelaces and spill yesterday into tomorrow, which was inconvenient because Captain Nebula—formerly Doug—had just ironed his timeline.
On the rye and crusty eve of our tale, I, a loafly baker who kneaded love, tried to roll with the punches, but my buns were toasted, my morals crumbled, and my prospects went a-rye as I buttered up fate, only to jam myself into a truly crum-believable mess.
Love hit Brenda like a swan-shaped paddleboat in a kiddie pool during a thunderstorm at noon, splashing her heart with tepid destiny as Todd, whose eyes were the color of a Wi‑Fi signal when it's strong, whispered "bonjourno" and she knew fate had finally subscribed to the premium plan of her feelings.
It was a high noon of indeterminate hour when the sun, fried to a crust like a desperado's conscience, dribbled yolk over a prairie as flat as a church pancake, while my spurs nagged the silence like debt collectors and my horse, a philosophical stew of hooves and sighs, considered the sheriff's mustache, which unfurled like destiny's tired lariat.
As the moon, that pallid pearl of nocturnal necklace, wept its silvers upon the quivering cobblestones, my heart—an overripe persimmon of destiny—sploshed within the ribcage cathedral, while time itself, wearing velvet slippers and perfumed with melancholy marmalade, tiptoed past eternity's yawning vestibule in bashful applause.
Veronica felt love strike her (not unlike a misfired Cupid arrow ricocheting off a discount heart-shaped balloon at the pharmacy where Fate, wearing a name tag, rang up her loneliness) when Percival's eyes—hazel, or perhaps soup—smoldered like damp confetti, promising forever in the same wheezing breath that apologized for his mother still living with him, romantically.
It was a dark and stormy knight, armored with morning, who stumbled into the deli of fate where I met my wurst enemy—the brat I couldn't ketchup to—while my heart, in a pickle, mustard the courage to relish love, only to find our romance was baloney, cold-cut short.
It was a bright and nappily ever-after morning when little Fluffernutter McGigglepants, age seven-and-a-half-and-two-crumbs, discovered his feelings were shaped like a soggy graham cracker and, clutching his emotionally supportive hamster, vowed to teach the alphabet to raindrops, beginning sensibly with the letter Q because it looked the most like a tadpole in a top hat.
It was a damp and binary dawn, the kind that uploaded dew into the cloud (not the sky-cloud but the other one), while the triple suns hiccupped over the chrome cul-de-sacs of Neo-Cedar Rapids, where Captain Vortex McNebula—half orphan, half algorithm—adjusted his feelings with a torque wrench and prepared to outthink destiny's captcha.
Love crashed into me like a swan-shaped paddle boat on a windless pond, splashing tepid destiny onto my cargo shorts, while Clarissa's eyes—two microwaved emeralds—blinked Morse code for 'forever' beneath eyebrows groomed like hedgerows, and I knew, as the mall fountain burbled our anthem, that soulmates accept coupons.
Detective Murgatroyd Peebles knew the corpse was guilty of something—existing—because it lay on the linoleum like a spilled rumor wearing shoes, as the neon blinked Morse apologies and the coffee confessed to third-degree bitterness, which, in this town, was as close to love as evidence ever got, and the clock offered an alibi so flimsy it would chafe a ghost.
As Captain Buck Thundershard adjusted his squeaking leather destiny-belt beneath the sneering moon, the jungle-ship-desert before him—half ocean, half rainforest, half Sahara—roared like a whispered secret, while his compass spun like a lazy hurricane, pointing everywhere at once except toward the treasure map tattooed backward on his own eyelids.
When Destiny, wearing a sequined tracksuit two sizes too hopeful, sashayed into the laundromat of my life, I felt my heart—stubborn as leftover lasagna in a flimsy Tupperware—reheat under her gaze, bubbling with passion and a faint whiff of fabric softener, while Cupid, that unpaid intern of love, stapled our damp souls together crookedly.
It was a heroically tepid dawn, the kind that bungee-cords the sun to the horizon before letting it plop, when Captain Thaddeus Rhombus (renowned in three taverns and one disgruntled lighthouse) unfurled his map—drawn on a napkin and destiny—toward the whispering jungle that smelled like wet treasure and impending paperwork.
It was a night so velveteen and moist that the moon, swollen with unshed pearls, dabbed at its lachrymose face with the hem of a cloud (embroidered, I assure you, by angels with arthritic fingers), while my heart—a chandelier of unbecoming hopes—clinked like nervous ice in the goblet of destiny's over-scented boudoir.
It was the kind of morning that dangles off the cliff of destiny by its fingernails, when our hero, Dirk Thunderflint (whose chin could navigate by star alone), unfolded a map so ancient it smelled like yesterday's soup, only to discover the X had moved, probably due to tides, earthquakes, or treachery, which are basically the same.
It was a twilight of baroque emotions, when the moon, fat as a smug pearl in a velvet gravy of sky, sighed its buttery light upon my trembling soul, whose diaphanous arteries quivered like harpstrings inside a cathedral of longing, while destiny, wearing damp socks of inevitability, tiptoed loudly down history's carpeted hallway.
It was a twilight so mauve that angels would have needed sunglasses, as the moon, swollen like a pompous blueberry in a velvet tuxedo, perspired silver onto the trembling cobblestones, while my heart, a baroque accordion of destiny and dampness, wheezed operatically beneath the chandeliered canopy of destiny's moist, perfumed inevitability.
It was a parched afternoon on the prairie, the kind that made the sun look like a fried egg dropped in the dust, when Sheriff Buckaroo McSpleen clinked into town (for it is in Dry Gulch that our scene limps), spurs chiming like church bells at a funeral for a tumbleweed, his six-shooter loaded with justice and damp regret.
Our love blossomed like a microwaved burrito at 3 a.m., steaming with destiny and oozing with fate, as Trevor (whose eyes were the exact Pantone of a recently rinsed supermarket grape) took my trembling hand in the rain that wasn't rain but God's perspiration, promising forever—or at least until his phone's battery, like my innocence, hit 1%.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping mayonnaise light upon the cobblestones, sighed its silver sorrows into the night while my heart, a baroque chandelier of feelings, jingled with emotional icicles and destiny's velvet hoofbeats clip-clopped like shy violins down the boulevard of time, which smelled, unmistakably, of regret, cinnamon, and damp wallpaper.
The moon, a pallid custard of celestial melancholy, dribbled its lachrymose light upon the quivering cobblestones (each a memoirist of rain), while my heart, upholstered in velvet despair and monogrammed ennui, throbbed like an overdressed hummingbird drowning in perfume, seeking destiny's tepid handshake behind a curtain of sighing lilacs.
It was a night so guilty even the moon pled the Fifth, and I, Dirk Mallard, private defective, waddled through the alley where the rain committed assault and battery on my hat, following clues so obvious they needed sunglasses, until the corpse introduced itself by odor alone and the dame's alibi winked at me with both elbows.
As the moon, fat as a complacent cheesewheel, perspired its buttery light across the lachrymose cobblestones, my soul—a fainting violet riding a chaise of sighs—unfurled like a damp napkin in the opera of destiny, where every heartbeat rang like a chandelier sneezing diamonds onto the velvet throat of midnight.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous Tuesday when Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more coffee than justice (and whose mustache resembled a crime scene chalk outline after a sneeze), followed a clue that smelled like regret and wet carpet to a corpse that was only mostly dead—socially speaking—lying beside a jealous stapler.
When Percival first glimpsed Melinda across the damp aisle of the midnight laundromat, her eyes—two overcaffeinated storm clouds swirling above a nose like a decisive apostrophe—wrung his heart like a wet sock, and he knew, with a passion both gluten-free and forever, that destiny had put their quarters in the same spin cycle.
The moon, a languorous pearl lounging in the velvet boudoir of heaven, sighed its milky breath upon the slumbering village as if blowing kisses to destiny, while my heart—an overripe pomegranate dripping rubies of yearning—throbbed like a wounded chandelier, tinkling with the crystalline agony of love's perfumed inevitability, resplendently moist and aflutter.
It was a damp and suspicious evening, the kind where the rain interrogates the pavement with tiny rubber-hose droplets, until (and I note this strictly for the record) the streetlight confessed to flickering, the alley pled guilty to smelling like trouble, and the corpse, inconveniently alive with rumors, refused to stop bleeding evidence.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of celestial yearning, dribbled its wan syrup over the cobblestones of destiny as my soul—swollen like a generously overwatered ficus—fluttered, floundered, and ultimately face-planted into the tepid puddle of love, whose ripples tolled like muffled bell-peals inside a velvet-lined teacup of fate.
It was the kind of night that wore a trench coat over a trench coat as Detective Dirk Gravel, whose five o'clock shadow had an alibi of its own, slithered into an alley where the chalk outline looked like a cloud that had given up, the sirens mewled, and the culprit's innocence screamed suspiciously in cursive.
It was a twilight of velvet mauve, draped like an embarrassed octopus over the pallid town, where the cobblestones (each a stubborn tooth in the grin of destiny) sweated with dew as my heart — a soufflé of yearning and regret — rose and collapsed in the oven of fate, perfuming eternity with an almost edible melancholy.
On the twelfth-and-a-half morn of King Henry the Eight-and-a-Bit's reign, when the Thames sloshed like tepid porridge against the palace's ankles, Lady Mildred of Nowhere-in-Particular clutched her chastity like a damp scone, foreseeing—via a horoscope in Latin-ish—the irreversible invention of the selfie and her imminent beheading, give or take.
On a night as cozy as a porcupine in pajamas, little Penelope Puddlepot (who was small but also not large, which is important for doors) crept across the nursery floorboards that squeaked like embarrassed mice, toward a cookie jar brimming with destiny crumbs, while the teddy bear jury (twelve stuffed peers) judged her with button-eyed jurisprudence.
It was a humid night in the city that never naps, and I, Dirk Gravel, private detectioneer, stood beneath a streetlamp contemplating the corpse which, like my alimony, refused to go away, except this one did, having been murdered twice—once by a bullet, and again by the killer's cologne, Eau de Motive, puddled beside a jelly donut of clues.
On the thirteenth midnight of the second Tuesday (which everyone in Gloomfordshire knows is the unluckiest, except for Thursdays), the moon oozed like a neglected wheel of cheese over Castle Dreadmire while Sir Neville Nightlight unsheathed his heirloom butter-knife-sword to duel a shrieking prophecy that kept reciting itself in italics inside his skull.
Once upon a time (which is like now but with more yesterdays), little Binky Bumblefluff, a rabbit of indeterminate fluffiness and bureaucratic ears, embarked heroically from his burrow-house to learn his ABCs—Already Being Cute—while the sun yawned awake like a giant lemon pancake and the clouds applauded politely, because that is what responsible weather does for brave, obedient children.
It was a blazing and suspiciously windy noon when Captain Barnaby Throttle, whose jaw was as square as an unfinished paragraph, unfolded a map so old it smelled like retired thunderstorms, and vowed to steal the Lost Emerald of Yowza from a jungle that hissed like a kettle full of snakes that hadn't read the instructions.
It was a dark and stormy vacuum, the kind that howled through the zero-G cul-de-sacs of Nebula Heights like a cosmic leaf blower, when Captain Flexor Quarkington, PhD (emotionally), flipped his quantum hair, checked his feelings app, and set the starship's Wi-Fi to 'stun,' heroically outrunning yesterday at precisely negative light-speed.
It was a swashbuckling sort of dawn, the kind that smelled like wet rope and canned bravado, when Captain Barnaby Throttle (PhD, self-awarded) unfolded a map so crinkled it sounded like destiny eating potato chips, while his compass spun nervously like a debutante on roller skates toward the Island of Certain Maybe Treasure.
It was a blisteringly tepid noon when Barnaby "Biff" Crumblethorpe—explorer, dentist, and part-time ukulele hypnotist—unfurled a map so soggy it wept in his trembling hands (sweat or destiny, who can say), and vowed to find the Lost Volcano of Whispering Bananas before the pirates, llamas, or his mother's book club beat him there.
It was a quantum midnight on Mars's least fashionable hemisphere, the stars buffering like cosmic dial-up while the red dust (which was actually more of an insecure salmon) exfoliated the domes, and Captain Zarg—part cyborg, part gluten-free—realized destiny's password had expired, again, because the universe keeps changing its special characters without texting anyone first.
It was a damp and heroic afternoon when Captain Buck Thunderpants strapped on his destiny (a squeaky life vest, two left boots, and a compass that pointed mostly at itself), squinted at a rum-crinkled map that was actually a Señor Taco placemat of Fate, and set sail inland toward the southerly north.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of destiny, dribbled its pallid syrup across the quivering soufflé of the night, while my heart, a fainting chaise lounge upholstered in sighs, reclined upon the velvet ottoman of despair and rang, like a chandelier strangled by pearls, for service that never came, alas, alas.
It was a moist evening of the heart when Claribel first beheld Trevor across the salad bar, his crouton-crumbed jawline brooding like a lighthouse in a fog of ranch dressing, and in that instant her soul slipped on love like an overripe banana skin and fell upward, gracelessly, into destiny's lukewarm embrace.
High noon slouched across the prairie like a tired egg yolk leaking over a chipped tin plate, while Sheriff Buck Rawhide (whose jaw could chisel ice or, failing that, corn) moseyed into Dustbucket with a prayer in his spurs and justice in his squint, as tumbleweeds rehearsed escape plans and the saloon piano forgot the tune of mercy.
When Detective Al Dente, a hard-boiled noodle with a pastasive-aggressive streak, took the case of the butchered butcher, he knew he had a steak in it, but as the plot thickened like week-old gravy he lost his thyme, missed his queue, and felt his sole slip through his loafers.
When Detective Al Dente took the case of the butchered baker—sliced kneadlessly and left to rye in peace—he knew he'd have to roll with the punches, grill the usual culprits, and, if thyme permitted, curry favor with a saucy informant, lest the whole affair crumble like a poorly buttered alibi.
As the sun hemorrhaged its golden ichor across the trembling horizon, which quivered like a flan confronted by existential dread (and who among us has not?), Esmeralda's heart—an overstuffed velvet loveseat of feelings upholstered in mauve sighs—swooned backward into destiny's arms, which were clammy, perfumed, and inexplicably wearing fingerless lace gloves.
It was a soggy Tuesday in Crumblytown, where the sun wore a raincoat and the sidewalks smelled like unsupervised oatmeal, when little Timmy-Pip (aged seven-and-three-quarters, but spiritually elderly) discovered that his imaginary friend, Mr. Bumblesnort, had filed for bankruptcy in the Court of Make-Believe and taken the crayons as alimony.
At the crack of a damp, indecisive dawn, Captain Buckle McThrust cinched his courage like an overcooked belt and consulted the map tattooed on his unreliable back, which perspired directions toward a forbidden jungle so dense you needed a machete for your thoughts, where rumors said the treasure waited, yawning impatiently.
It was a nap-time so enormous that it blanketed the nursery like a sluggish walrus in a sweater, as little Timmy—aged somewhere between three and eternity—clutched his emotionally ambiguous teddy, Sir Fuzzington IV, and prepared to learn about sharing, taxes, and the surprising mouthfeel of paste through the magic of friendship.
It was a humid night in Gristle City, the kind that made trench coats weep and alibis perspire, when I, Dirk Lamprey, licensed sleuth (renewal pending), found a corpse that wasn't dead yet but had every intention of being, sprawled like last week's lasagna, leaking secrets, marinara, and something legally actionable.
It was a dank and stormy knight, whose armor rustled like lettuce as he romaine-d calm, but I couldn't ketchup with his saucy past—he was a cereal killer who didn't give a grain, flourished false thyme alibis, and, in a final twist of fate, proposed we elope so our troubles wood knot be-leafed.
It was a damp and pun-gent evening when I mustard the courage to ketchup with my ex, a saucy pickled lawyer who relished malpracticum, and though I'd sworn to lettuce romaine apart, she strode in with buns of steel and a chip on her shoulder, dill-iberately roasting my ham-handed heart.
It was the day the compass lost interest in north and began ogling west, when Captain Biceps McStubble, armed with a map that cried ink-tears in the rain, thundered into the jungle on a wheezing camel-boat, swearing to retrieve the Emerald of Tomorrow from yesterday's volcano, while parrots whispered spoilers and the horizon kept moving the goalposts.
As the moon, plump as a peeled grape lounging on velvet, drooled its buttery light over the melancholy gazebo of my heart, the night exhaled perfumed sighs through the lace-curtained nostrils of the town, and Destiny, wearing a feather boa of inevitability and cheap cologne, sashayed toward me on stiletto raindrops of fate.
It was a pun-ishingly dreary mourning when Detective Cole Slaw, tossed by romain-ing doubts, beet his head against the case of the missing baker—who, having no dough to knead, had fled in crust, leaving roll models crumbling and a trail of breadcrumbs that was, crouton my word, stale as yesterday's news.
It was high noon, or maybe low noon (the clock in Dead Man's Gulch saloon hiccupped like a drunkard), when Sheriff Lint McGrit rode into town on a horse so tired it yawned dust, his spurs jangling like angry teaspoons and his eyes squinting harder than the sun, which was squinting back with cactus-flavored contempt.
It was a daring noon when the sun, squatting on the horizon like a lazy toad who'd lost its lily pad (or perhaps its will), glared so hard at Captain Bramble St. Valiant that his map perspired, his compass winced, and the jungle coughed up secrets in Morse code, inviting him to destiny, danger, and a light lunch—mostly destiny.
It was a night so velveteen and perfumed that even the moon, bashful as a dowager's lapdog in lace, pouted behind a diaphanous cloud while the stars, scattered like remorseful rhinestones on the bodice of oblivion, blinked moistly at Trevor, whose soul—marinated in yearning, regret, and inexpensive cologne—throbbed like a wounded chandelier.
Upon the velveteen bosom of the evening, where moonbeams dripped like sentimental fondue over the buttered scone of the horizon, Persephone Wimple—her eyes twin lagoons of periwinkle despair—exhaled a sigh so perfumed and purple that the lilies fainted and the stars dabbed discreetly at their mascara.
It was a dark and stormy knight who had lost his patience and his patients, trudging through the rain in boots so soleful they wept, following a cereal killer's gristly trail of bran-new clues down a wheyward alley, where thyme stood still and the stakes were rare, but well done.
Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat smelled like a damp alibi left too long in the fridge, knew the case was fishy because the corpse was alive with rumors and dead with facts, and as the city dripped neon like a bleeding highlighter he vowed to arrest the truth, resisting arrest though it was.
It was a sweaty afternoon in the small town of Heartgrove when Madison's love life (which had been kept in a Tupperware of loneliness since prom night) burped open, and out wafted Trevor—musked like a microwaved cinnamon roll—whose eyes were like two Wi‑Fi bars promising connection but delivering buffering.
Once upon a time, in a town so safe even the shadows had helmets, where the sidewalks wore gum like medals and the clouds drooped like lactose-laden elephants (not that elephants should be eaten, children), little Timmy McSprout, aged seven-and-three-quarters-but-small-for-his-age, discovered Responsibility behind the sofa, meowing faintly like a homework kitten, and adopted it forever, except on weekends.
It was a dry and dusty dusk in Dry Gulch, where the sun sank like a blood-orange flapjack into a skillet of horizon while Sheriff Cactus McGravel, whose mustache had seen more action than the telegraph, clanked down Main Street as tumbleweeds committed slow-motion crimes and the cactus applauded politely with needles.
On the eve when the village's twin moons clattered like loose dentures in the sky, the castle (formerly a quaint B&B, now inconveniently haunted) exhaled a sigh so damp it mildewed my courage; then the prophecy—handwritten in glitter ink on human skin—cleared its throat and began to happen at me.
On the morning of the Magna Carta (which, despite rumors, was neither a menu nor a map), King John awoke with the hangover of a thousand Saxons and, girding his loins like an indecisive sausage, oozed toward Runnymede where history (needing signatures like a desperate landlord) prepared to be notarized by quills sharp enough to shave a bishop.
Once upon a drizzly nap-time (which is a time between times when clocks yawn and socks lose their toes), little Timmy-Wimmy-Bimmy, aged approximately five-and-three-quarters give or take a fortnight, bravely munched his feelings like slightly stale animal crackers, because adventures (especially indoors) are best narrated with whisper-shouts and carefully supervised imagination scissors.
Their love crashed into the cafeteria like a microwave burrito exploding at 2:17 a.m., scalding yet undercooked, while Trevor, whose eyes were the color of blue that's on toothpaste boxes, felt his heart swan-dive into destiny as Janine whispered 'sup' with lips glossy as a new credit card in a wallet sweating with commitment.
It was a daring and stormless noon when Captain Dirk Thunderpants, whose jaw was so square it had corners, unfurled his map (which was printed on the skin of a rumor) and vowed to sail the Sahara by horseback-submarine, because treasure waits for no man, except when it does, especially after lunch.
The moon, a pallid custard of celestial regret, dribbled its lachrymose mayonnaise upon the quivering rooftops as my heart, a wounded accordion stuffed with perfumed thunder, wheezed sonnets into the velvet-brocade night where destiny, wearing tap shoes and a bathrobe of sighs, minced toward me with ornamental doom.
It was a perilous dawn on the Island of Certain Doom, where the sun rose like a swollen tangerine over a treacherous sea of mayonnaise, and I, Captain Dirk Thunderblaze, tightened my squeaky bootlaces and promised destiny a wedgie as my map, printed on ham, quivered with prophetic dampness.
Once upon a time in a kindergarten so sticky that your shoes made the sound of regret, little Timmy, whose eyes sparkled like unflushed goldfish, embarked on a quest to share his feelings about sharing, which, like broccoli in a raincoat, seemed unnecessary, until the crayons staged a colorful coup d'état against the tyranny of inside voices.
It was the dawniest dusk of 1066, when the Norman fog rolled in like a tapestry unrolling itself (with all the subtlety of a trebuchet marketing campaign), and I, Mildred of Somewhere-Upon-Else, clutching my quill as if it were Excalibur's gluten-free cousin, resolved to chronicle destiny before it spoiled.
It was a dark and stormy night in Punderland, where the mayor was under a cloud and the baker kneaded help, for the butcher, cut to the chase, had a beef with the candlestick-maker who waxed poetic until the situation grew wick-ed, and I, a grocer by trade, couldn't produce a single decent alibi, leaving me the sole suspect.
It was a damp and eldritch twilight, the kind that smells like soggy dragon laundry, when the moon, looking like a peeled eyeball forgotten in a goblin's lunch pail, winked at me conspiratorially and the castle sighed like a lactose-intolerant basilisk, as destiny knocked—twice—on the crypt door with skeletal knuckles wearing fingerless gloves.
It was a Tuesday on Mars—which is like a Monday but redder and with sand in the Wi‑Fi—when Captain Chad Nebula (decorated twice, laminated once) realized the universe was expanding faster than his trousers, as Station M.O.M. nagged the asteroid belt into neat rings and a black hole yawned like a cosmic donut bored of breakfast.
It was a dank and stormy brine in the seaside deli where my heart, marinated in thyme because time wounds all heels, was filleted by an organ-ized crime wave that left me with no guts to mustard a defense, only a searing need to ketchup to my saucy past and relish revenge, come what may-onaise.
Clarissa's heart, a skittish hamster on the squeaky wheel of destiny, thudded like a malfunctioning dishwasher when Bradlynn (whose eyes were the exact color of a question mark dipped in overcast sea) exhaled near her earlobe, and the scent of his cologne—Wet Thunder #7—tangoed with her hopes in orthopedic shoes toward forever.
Detective Basil Thyme, once a big dill, found himself in quite a pickle at the scene of the salad days massacre—heads of romaine rolled, hearts of palm palmed, and the sole witness, a shellfish ex-lover, clammy and tight-lipped—so I tossed the case, dressing down the suspects until someone cracked, because I couldn't leaf well enough alone and was, frankly, tired of getting beet.
On a dark and stormy knight who'd lost his armor and his temper, the tavern served murder most fowl as the chicken crossed the crime scene to get to the other sigh'd—thyme of death 7:08, the gravy was grave, the steaks were high, and, lettuce be frank, I couldn't ketchup with the currant events without yolking.
Veronica's heart thudded like a confused walrus on a trampoline as Bryce, whose jawline could slice deli meat and whose eyes were the color of indecisive glaciers, sauntered toward her through the aromatically moist fog of the discount rose aisle, destiny squeaking in their sneakers like Cupid's poorly oiled shopping cart.
Geraldine felt love slam into her chest like a swan wearing chain mail colliding with a greenhouse during a drizzle that thought it was a storm; across the café (which smelled courageously of burnt milk), Percival winked—clumsily, heroically—as their souls high-fived, leaving her heart squeaking like an underinflated accordion.
It was a bright and quantumly overcast dawn on Planet Xerox-12, where the twin suns blinked like faulty LEDs and the asteroid belt formed a frown, as Captain Nebula Jones uploaded his courage.exe into his chest cavity and bravely tiptoed his star-yacht into hyperspace, which smelled, quite surprisingly, of burnt toast and unreturned library books.
When Detective Al Dente arrived at the pasta factory to investigate the saucy affair, he felt penne for the guy who'd been lasagna-ed in the press by an impasta, a noodle attempt at a cover-up that left him shell-shocked, bow-tied in farfalle conclusions, and rigatoni-ing the bells for a pesto-mortem with raviol-ing motives.
On a night made of lukewarm cocoa and whimpering moonbeams, little Tibbly Wibbins (who, as everyone knows, was eight-and-a-half going on infinity) tiptoed past the snoring daisies toward the Forbidden Cupboard of Bedtime Snacks, where destiny (and a morally instructive raisin) awaited, rustling ominously like a library book nobody wanted to read aloud.
It was the kind of murder that makes a city sweat like a guilty ham under a heat lamp, the victim sprawled across her own alibi like punctuation in a ransom note, while I, Vince Gravel, P.I., sifted clues from my ashtray of a soul and found only lipstick, lies, and the unmistakable whiff of yesterday's betrayal doing jazz hands.
Upon the velveteen hush of evening, when the moon bled custard over the pouting hills and the stars preened like sequins on the bodice of night, my heart—a fainting sofa of emotions—swooned fragrantly, ricocheting like a lost perfume bottle through the labyrinthine nostrils of destiny.
It was a briskly tepid dawn when Captain Barnaby Quill, whose mustache curled like a question mark too curious to be answered, unfolded the map he had found in his grandmother's teapot, a parchment so mysterious that even the compass blushed, pointing not north but toward destiny, danger, and a discount souvenir kiosk.
The sun, a fried egg left too long on the cast-iron of destiny, slid off the sky's plate as Sheriff Buckle—whose boots jangled with the melancholy of untipped pianos and whose hat brim could eclipse a prairie schooner—squinted at the horizon (east, today, inexplicably) where an outlaw tumbleweed appeared to be drawing a pistol.
It was on the kind of morning that wakes up late and puts its socks on backwards that Captain Buckley Thrasher, gripping a map tattooed on a suspiciously tanned pelt that might have been his own back in another life, set sail into the jungle, because rivers are just horizontal cliffs, chasing treasure that smelled loudly of destiny and mildew.
It was a quantum and stormy night in Sector 12—where the stars hummed like microwaved bees and the nebulae smelled faintly of burnt toast (owing, no doubt, to the ship's disgruntled AI chef)—as Captain Dirk Nebulon flipped his hair, his warp-drive, and, regrettably, the universe's polarity, all with one buttery wink.
It was the kind of murder that hits you like a soft-boiled egg fired from a tuba—sudden, oozing, faintly musical—as I, Detective Dirk Gravel, sloshed through a rain that felt like God's sweaty alibi, sniffed the crime scene with my magnifying glass, and knew from the victim's missing eyebrows that the perp had an axe to grid.
It was a dry and sticky night in Gristle City when Detective Lance Mallory, whose jawline could slice deli meat and whose trench coat smelled faintly of regrets and powdered sugar, discovered that the corpse in Apartment 3B had not only been murdered twice, but had also stolen his wallet, his alibi, and, unforgivably, his last jelly donut.
On a sunshiny Tuesday that smelled like wet crayons and faintly of broccoli burps, little Periwinkle Puddleton, who was seven-and-three-quarters if you counted the time he spent waiting for toast, discovered that his teddy bear, Mr. Bumblebottom von Snugglefluff, could talk in italics, which was inconvenient because the goldfish kept interrupting with interpretive bubble translations.
It was a bold and soggy dawn when Captain Thaddeus Brickjaw, gripping his grandfather's melted compass and a map drawn on what might have been ham, vowed to discover the Lost Mountain of Ocean, which everyone said was underwater but also somehow on fire, while the parrots heckled and the horizon tripped over itself like a drunk plank.
On a night soggier than a microwaved burrito forgotten under the moon, Desiree felt destiny burp through the cosmos as Lance—whose eyes were the heroic color of thawing peas—collided lips with her like two bashful manatees bowling, while Cupid, stealing his neighbor's Wi‑Fi, buffered their passion between ads for discount cinnamon candles.
Clarissa knew it was love the moment Brad's eyes collided with hers like two shopping carts in the fluorescent wasteland of aisle seven, sparks spraying, mangled wheels squealing, while destiny, wearing a discount sticker, slid between them like warm supermarket rotisserie chicken, basting her heart with greasy longing and a hint of lemon-pepper regret.
It was a bright and ominously beige dawn when Captain Brick Mallory strapped on his squeaking destiny, a frayed fanny pack bulging with courage, beef jerky, and an unhelpful map drawn by a man with no thumbs; somewhere beyond the yawning horizon, danger snickered like a damp match, and the compass pointed determinedly toward "adventure-ish."
It was the year 1066-ish, when England wore chainmail like a prickly sweater and destiny kept hitting snooze, that Sir Nigel of Spreadsheet-on-Avon (so named for his meticulous parchments) strode through the fog (or possibly soup), vowing to conquer love, France, and his mother's passive-aggressive embroidery.
Her heart, a microwaved croissant of desire, flaked apart as Bradlynn—whose eyes were the color of that moss you find on forgotten salad—strode into the laundromat like a thundercloud in skinny jeans, and I knew, as surely as a GPS recalculating in a tunnel, that destiny had no quarters left.
Biceps bulging like two disgruntled muskrats in a burlap sack, Captain Dirk Thunderclasp adjusted his squid-ink map under the scowling moon and vowed to find the Lost Volcano of Atlantis before breakfast, unless of course destiny, indigestion, or the treacherous whispers of his talking canteen persuaded him otherwise.
It was a moist afternoon of destiny when Claribel first beheld Trevor across the salad bar, his eyes like two lukewarm cappuccinos brimming with foam and secrets, and her heart, which had been single since birth (except for brief engagements to poetry and a parakeet), pirouetted like a shopping cart toward inevitable matrimony.
It was a daringly tepid dawn when Captain Bartholomew "Boomerang" Bracklethwaite, whose chin was a cliff and whose boat was mostly holes, set sail across the beige, yawning sea of Destiny, guided only by a map he'd spilled soup on and the compass of his heart, which, regrettably, pointed true south toward peril, paperwork, and Aunt Mildred.
Elaine's heart, a microwaved marshmallow in the rainstorm of destiny, oozed toward Trevor, whose eyes were the exact color of a blueberry yogurt left open in a midsummer office kitchenette, while the moon—pregnant with clichés—labored over the parking lot, pushing out a tide that sloshed intimately against our souls like undercooked risotto.
On a night as moist as an overcooked lasagna, Captain Buckle McHarpoon (whose jaw was chiseled by a vengeful glacier) unfurled the map that smelled like regret and parrot droppings, while his compass, insulted by magnetism itself, spun like gossip, pointing him simultaneously toward the Jungle of Peril and his unresolved childhood.
It was high noon except where the sun forgot, and the tumbleweeds (which were really just orphaned thoughts of the prairie) bumbled across Bootlace Gulch as Sheriff Curdle McGrit squinted so hard at destiny that his mustache creaked like an old saloon door paying rent in nickels of dust.
Detective Maureen "Moe" Mallard knew the case stank worse than a week-old tuna melt left on a radiator in late August as she squinted through the venetian blinds that cut the dawn into bacon strips, because the corpse on her office rug, wearing only socks and a look of recalcitrant surprise, had somehow signed her business card.
It was a musk-scented dawn in the Year of Our Lord 1521, when the sun rose like a freshly buttered codpiece over a Europe trembling with Reformation notifications, and young Lady Mildred of Spreadsheet Abbey clutched her quill like a selfie-stick, vowing to update history itself, one parchment status at a time, lol.
Moonbeams dripped like buttery chandeliers onto the trembling bosom of the midnight meadow, where my sigh, a velvet hurricane embroidered with wistful sequins, tangoed with the perfumed fog, and destiny—wearing a moth-eaten tuxedo of fate—winked at me with the clammy eyelashes of eternity's moist, inexplicable armpit.
It was a humid twilight of the heart, and Desire—damp as a forgotten washcloth behind love's sink—slapped against Dolores like a screen door in a hurricane as she gazed into Lance's suspiciously symmetrical eyes, where galaxies of promises orbited coupons of commitment, while violins sobbed somewhere near her pancreas and destiny missed its exit again.
It was a yeast of times and the wurst of times, I mustard the courage to ketchup with the butcher's cutthroat clientele, who were hanging on my every wurd as I relished the chance to meat my fate, tenderizing the moment with ham-fisted appeals and bologna excuses until someone finally gave me the chop.
It was a night so voluptuously velveteen that the moon, a lachrymose wheel of wan cheese, dripped pallid romance onto the cobblestones like perfumed candle wax, while my heart, a baroque hedgehog in a corset of sighs, pirouetted through the alleys of destiny, tripping over adjectives strewn like sequins on the somnambulent bosom of eternity.
Once upon a time, in a nursery so safe the corners wore helmets, little Puddlebun the rabbit (who was technically a hare but didn't like labels) embarked on a daring adventure to the Forbidden Cupboard of Slightly Higher Shelves, where the cookies whispered legal disclaimers and the night-light blinked Morse code for 'nap now, citizen.'
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of nocturnal nostalgia, dribbled its opalescent mayonnaise upon the quivering city (which, I assure you, was very metropolitan indeed), while my heart—like a fainting sofa upholstered in destiny's damp doilies—throbbed with the sepia thunder of love, or indigestion, whichever wore the grander epaulettes of yearning.
The moon, a pallid pearl drooling its lachrymose mayonnaise upon the curdled custard of the night, sighed across the tremulous rooftops as my soul, a chandelier of trembling spoons, jangled with destiny's damp handshake, while fate, smelling faintly of lilacs and taxidermy, fluttered its velveteen eyelashes at my quivering, baroque heart.
It was a night so opulently velvet that the moon perspired pearls onto the trembling custard of the sky, while my heart, a baroque armadillo in a waistcoat of yearning, tap-danced upon the porcelain saucer of destiny as the wind, utterly perfumed with nostalgia and damp socks, whispered operas into the bewildered eyebrows of the city.
As the moon perspired its cheesy glow upon the cul-de-sac of destiny, Clarissa found her heart (shaped like a lopsided turnip, thanks to yoga) defibrillated by Trevor's gaze—two bluish orbs like dented hubcaps in a puddle—while their souls high-fived awkwardly, promising forever after, or at least until his wi-fi reconnected.
The moon, a languid pearl lounging on the plush velvet chaise of the sky, sighed its milky perspiration upon the town as if buttering toast with light, while my heart, a trembling chandelier of emotions, tinkled with crystallized yearning in the ballroom of my chest, where destiny waltzed in squeaky shoes.
It was a dark and stormy gnocchi, when Detective Al Dente—no mere impasta—followed a sauce-picious trail through the rigamaroni factory, sifting through capers with thyme to kill, until the victim, a real roll model, turned up crummy and buttered, leaving only rye remarks and a stale-mate that kneaded no further proof: murder most grain.
It was love at first sniff when Clarissa, whose heart had the structural integrity of overcooked linguine, inhaled Brad's cologne—a bouquet suggesting wet gym socks romancing a pine tree—and felt Cupid, clumsy as a toddler with a nail gun, staple destiny to her ribcage under the flickering fluorescence of Aisle Seven.
As the sun slathered the horizon in a blush the color of overripe salmon, Desiree's heart performed a congested waltz inside her ribcage Tupperware while Brad—whose eyes were like two sapphires microwaved on high—approached with a bouquet of discount roses and the musky confidence of a cologne sample gone feral.
It was a humid afternoon in the discount candle aisle when Bernice's heart, shaped like a bruised peach and twice as needy, lurched toward Chadwick, whose cologne smelled like thunderstorms trapped in a gym sock, and destiny hiccuped, then burped loudly, as their eyes collided like two shopping carts at the clearance bin of love.
Once upon a time in the cozy yet mysteriously damp town of Snugglebottom-on-Mildew, little Timmy Tiddlewink, who was allergic to joy, sunshine, and—most regrettably—puppies, set forth (with his mother's permission slip triple-signed) to discover the true meaning of sharing, which, according to Aunt Griselda's pamphlet, involved spreadsheets, turnips, and mandatory glitter allocation.
It was a damp and morally inconvenient evening when Detective Dirk Gravel (whose hat brim shadowed his past as convincingly as a budget eclipse) found the corpse of Mr. Innocent on the floor like a spilled secret, which was odd because secrets don't bleed unless you count gossip, which I do.
It was a night so guilty it would plead the Fifth to the moon, which hung like a baleful streetlamp over Gristle Alley, where I, Nick Hardcase, licensed detective and unlicensed romantic, stepped in a puddle that looked like spilled merlot but smelled like regret and pennies—murder's calling card, pressed between the city's sweaty palms.
It was a humid evening in Poughkeepsie when Desiree first beheld Todd, and her heart, like a microwaved marshmallow forgotten in a laundromat's lost-and-found, swelled, collapsed, and stuck to everything, while his eyes, twin manholes of passion, yawned open and swallowed her with the gentle subtlety of a leaf blower on prom night.
It was a midnight so midnighty that even the moon, pale as a frightened turnip, hid behind its own shadow, while the ancient castle (which locals avoided except when they didn't) exhaled a sigh of cobwebs and destiny; and from the well in the pantry came the polite, damp footsteps of something that had not yet been born.
It was a swashbuckling noon when the sun, dull as a butter knife yet somehow stabbing, hacked at the horizon while Captain Bucklethorpe—renowned (by himself) for valorous cowardice—unfurled a mildewed map that smelled like wet heroism, consulting a compass that pointed everywhere at once toward certain treasure and even more certain peril, romance, and chafing.
It was a dawn like an embarrassed bruise, mauve and moist, caressing the town with the tender ferocity of a velvet sledgehammer, as my heart—an overripe mango of longing dripping sticky sonnets—throbbed beneath ribs that were cages and also wings, fluttering toward destiny's tepid embrace with the grace of a falling soufflé.
It was a humid and suspicious afternoon when Captain Buckleby Thrasher, clutching a map so secret it had Xs all over it, boldly tiptoed into the jungle (the green kind, not the urban kind) where drums throbbed like anxious kidneys and every vine tried to handshake him with murderous, strangly enthusiasm toward destiny and/or quicksand.
It was a neon and plasma night aboard the starship Innuendo, where time dripped like lukewarm pudding through the cracked hourglass of hyperspace, as Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum monocle and realized, with a gasp that echoed in zero gravity like a lonely kazoo, that the universe's firewall had feelings and they were hurt.
It was a humid night in Sweltering Falls, and I could practically hear the crime rate perspiring, as the streetlights blinked Morse code at my trench coat and the corpse on Pier 7 lay there inconsiderately, refusing to explain itself, while my cigarette wept tarry commas that punctuated an alibi so full of holes it could juggle knives.
It was a bravely tepid dawn when Captain Buckaroo McThistle, whose eyes were the color of unpromising kelp, strapped on his fraying courage like a squeaky life vest and vowed, upon the surprisingly moist map of Legend Harbor, to discover the Unfindable Island that everyone kept misplacing behind rumors and poorly stapled fog.
It was a humid night in the city of Sinford, where the fog wore a trench coat and the streetlights smoked cigarettes, when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose eyes were two unsolved crosswords, realized the victim was dead and deceased, a condition that, like his marriage, appeared permanent, except for clues, which were everywhere and none of them helpful.
It was a dark and stormy vacuum, the kind that howls soundlessly across the infinite cul-de-sac of Space (Sector 7½, for the GPS-impaired), as Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum monocle and bravely stapled the warp-drive's user manual to the event horizon, lest the saucy androids misunderstand his feelings again.
It was the kind of murder that arrives like a bus that's early and late, thought Detective Dirk Drizzle, tipping his fedora to the corpse sprawled like a dropped soufflé on the linoleum of Larry's Larceny Laundromat, where the stiff clues were as soggy as the rinse cycle and yet screamed louder than a cat wearing sirens in a library.
At the hour when the moon perspired pearls onto the velveteen custard of the heavens, Claribel, a chandelier of a woman whose soul wore lace like a widow's eyebrow, sashayed into destiny's vestibule, where fate, smelling faintly of lavender despair and yesterday's soup, waited like a patient hippopotamus in sequins.
It was a dusty and suspicious afternoon in Cactus Guzzle, where the sun hung over Main Street like a sheriff's badge left too long on a griddle, and the tumbleweeds tiptoed past the saloon doors with the guilty hush of church mice in chaps, while my six-shooter, lethally unloaded, clicked philosophical objections at destiny.
Detective Vince Mackerel, whose trench coat flapped like a wounded albatross and smelled faintly of mysteries and actual fish (long story, cousin runs a deli), surveyed the crime scene—a puddle of streetlight and regret where the victim lay as horizontal as a broken promise—and deduced, with grim professional pizzazz, that murder was involved, probably.
When Detective Cole Slaw stepped into the salad bar of justice, he knew this case would be no picnic, because the victim—one Mr. Basil Leaves—had been tossed, dressed down, and Romaine cold, and every suspect had an alibi they couldn't kale, which really beet all, lettuce pray.
Detective Brie Gouda, a hard-case with a soft rind, knew he had a whey with words when the case of the murdered baker turned sour-dough: the victim was kneaded to death, the perpetrator left no crumb of evidence, and every alibi was half-baked, which, to be frankfurter, made the whole ordeal wurst.
The starship Breadcrumb panted through space like a tired Labrador in a vacuum, which is impossible but go with it, its quantum-magma engines sputtering emojis of despair on the diagnostics while Captain Vesper McTorque adjusted his feelings with a spanner and prepared to time-travel to last Tuesday to prevent tomorrow's salad from betraying humanity.
On the pomegranate-velveteen cusp of an evening so voluptuously twilighted that the moon blushed like a debutante in a cold-cream catastrophe, Nigel's soul—soused in nostalgia, marinated in melancholy, flambéed in fate—tiptoed across the parquet of destiny, whose boards squeaked sonnets of sorrow while the chandeliers perspired diamonds like nervous duchesses at a scandalized cotillion.
The map I found taped to the underside of Aunt Mildred's fruitcake (a cartographic pastry if you will) promised Adventure with a capital A, so with my compass spinning like a confused disco ball, my heart drumming laundry, and the volcano vomiting foreshadow, I strode bravely into the jungle that smelled suspiciously of neon destiny and damp socks.
When Detective Colleen Oscopy plunged into the bowels of the city's seedy underbelly, she had a gut feeling the case would be intestinally complicated, because every lead was crap-shoot thin, every stool pigeon loose, and the killer—rumored to be a colonel—kept leaving semicolons where bodies should have been full stops.
It was a stark and corny night, and I maize well confess I felt a kernel of fear as the cobs conspired, for my stalk-er ex (a real husky fellow) had crept up beetween rows, romaine-cing the idea of our re-leek-ationship, while I, not wanting to kale it quits, just couldn't mustard the thyme.
It was a rare mistake, I confess, but when I met my butcher lover at the steak-out behind the deli, I knew I had meated my match: a prime cut-up with a tender loin for lies, a gristle-while-you-work ethic, and an offal habit of telling tripe, which left my heart cured, my morals minced, and my future ground chuck.
It was a dark and stormy knight who met his match at the butcher's, where murder most fowl left no clucks to give, the odor was pun-gent, the scene a rare steak-out, and I, a seasoned investigator, couldn't ketchup, mustard the courage, or relish the thought of the wurst.
On a swashbuckling noon of destiny, when the sun glared like a suspicious landlord at the rent-late ocean, Captain Bixby Throttle (whose name alone smelled of leather and marmalade) unfolded the moldy map that led everywhere and nowhere at once, except on weekends, and vowed to boldly dare the forbidding archipelago of Certain Peril, probably.
On the precipice of destiny, which looked like a soggy baguette left on a windowsill of fate, Captain Barnaby Thrust tightened his squeaky boots, unfolded a map so old it smelled like retired pirates, and vowed to go anywhere adventure dared him not to, even if that meant inland, uphill, and inconveniently into a volcano.
It was a moist and quivering evening when Desire, wearing a cardigan two sizes too earnest, tiptoed into Marjorie's spinster heart like a raccoon through a deli, rustling the wax paper of her feelings while Brad—whose eyes were the color of expensive window cleaner—declared, "I love you" to the wrong reflection in a café spoon.
Upon the velvet-swathed bosom of the universe, where moonbeams languished like overcooked spaghetti on the pallid cheek of destiny, I, Baron Leander Heftfluff, exhaled a sigh so plush and perfumed that even the swooning chrysanthemums blushed mauve, confessing secrets to my brocade-shadowed soul in whispering italics.
Olivia's heart, a soggy croissant of yearning laminated in layers of sorrow and hope, flaked as Brad, whose eyes were like microwaved sapphires forgotten in the break room, waltzed into the laundromat smelling of fabric softener and destiny, tangling our souls like damp socks that refuse to separate no matter how vigorously you shake the basket of fate.
It was a midnight of the sort moons prefer when they are feeling peevish, and as the castle yawned like a toothy tomb with a draft, Princess Gloomsbury unsheathed her ancestral prophecy (which was mostly rash) while the shadow behind her cleared its throat politely and began chewing on her destiny like stale bread.
It was a damp and clammy evening when Desire, wearing a trench coat two sizes too tight, tiptoed into Brenda's ventricles and jiggled the handle, while Nigel—whose jaw was a misdelivered package and whose eyes were lukewarm tea—whispered 'hello' so seductively that the begonias filed HR complaints and the moon blushed a sallow beige.
It was a humid Tuesday of the heart when Desire, perspiring like a cheese under cling film, clutched Trevor's memory-foam soul, and as the moon blinked coquettishly like a faulty streetlamp over the cul-de-sac of destiny, our narrator (me) swooned, tripped, and fell irrevocably in like with his aggressively beige aura.
The moon, obese and pimply as a neglected cheese, drooled its curdled light upon Gristlewick, where I (Percival Nightshade—half-orphan, quarter-elf, full-time barista) discovered that the ancient prophecy tattooed on my spleen had started itching again, coincidentally at the exact moment the church bells burped midnight and the cemetery began to breathe like a congested accordion.
When the morgue's new coroner, Dr. Al Bumin, said he had a gut feeling about the case, I stomach-ached to listen, but he just kept organ-izing his thoughts, spleen-didly, until the suspect livered himself to the station, confessing he couldn't kidney his crimes any longer, which, in hindsight, was offal predictable.
When the butcher was found minced in his own shop, the rumor mill ground to a halt, though Officer Brisket—no stranger to offal truths—vowed to cut to the chase with a cleaver alibi, grilling every prime suspect until someone tendered a confession, because the stakes were rare and he couldn't stomach another cold case.
Like a velvet tsunami of moonlight spilled from a rhinestoned sky onto the quivering soufflé of the city, Veronica's sigh—half turtledove, half malfunctioning accordion—fluttered down the cul-de-sac of destiny, where puddles posed as mirrors and even the manholes blushed, because love, that slippery marmalade of the soul, had finally overcooked.
It was the kind of Renaissance morning that Michelangelo would have painted if he'd had a selfie stick, dawn yawning like a lion with halitosis over Florence, where I, Giovanna di Something-or-Other, quill trembling like a leaf in a barber's soup, prepared to betray my betrothed for a crate of nutmeg and the future invention of democracy.
It was a musk-scented dawn in 1789 Paris, when the sun guillotined the horizon with a yolky blade while geese (ardent Royalists, by the gossip of gutters) honked their dissent, and young Éloi—whose destiny was stitched tighter than his breeches—resolved to storm history itself, once he located his misplaced tricorn and a suitably vengeful baguette.
In the mustard dawn of our thyme, when fate kneaded me like offal dough and left me proofing in a lukewarm life, I met Rosemary—basilisk-eyed and cumin-on strong—who promised we'd ketchup on our past mis-steaks and lettuce romaine calm, only to leave me pickled, grated, and utterly souperfluous to her coarse, cursed menu.
It was a dark and stormy nebula, the kind that thundered silently because space is shy, when Captain Nebbish Throttlecock, whose chin was handsomer than his face, steered the starcruiser Unpaid Internship into destiny's clogged wormhole, where time dilated like elastic sweatpants and the aliens smelled mysteriously of yesterday's Wi‑Fi.
It was a dark and starry vacuum, the kind that hums (if vacuums could hum, which this one did) as the starship Obvious Allegory creaked through the cul-de-sac, its quantum-coffee machine sputtering like a dying pulsar while Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his ego—pardon, ego-matic—drive and prepared to outrun yesterday's future again with the grace of a wormhole in loafers.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; the quantum rain fell in tachyonic torrents—except at occasional intervals when the ship's emotions, uploaded into the weather, sighed through the bulkheads like a lovesick airlock—while Captain Vortex, half android and three-quarters poet, recalibrated destiny with a bent spork and a hangover algorithm.
When Trevor, whose eyes were the color of uncommitted rainwater, brushed my elbow in the supermarket's frozen-vegetable grotto, my heart detonated like a soufflé in a tumble dryer, scattering feelings, coupons, and destiny alike, and I knew, with the damp certainty of a foggy sponge, that our love would be forever, or at least until checkout.
It was a sparkly and nap-inducing morning in Giggle Glen when Prunella Puddle-Pants, age seven-and-three-quarters (give or take a fortnight, as verified by her stuffed tax auditor), discovered that friendship, like lukewarm porridge, thickens if you don't stir it—especially when your best pal is a whispering turnip wearing your grandmother's dentures.
It was a hypergalactic night; the stars blinked like lethargic routers in a cosmic office park while the nebula (which is Latin for "cloud," I looked it up on Wikipedius Prime) drizzled ionized drizzle onto Captain Vrax's gleaming yet emotionally unavailable starship, whose AI, Brenda-7, softly rebooted the universe by accident, or on purpose—details pending an internal audit.
On the night the baker was found kneaded to death, Detective Cole Slaw arrived in a dressing gown, tossed the salad of suspects with relish, and mustard the courage to ketchup on clues, only to discover the culprit was the butcher's wife, who couldn't meat his needs and thus tenderized their relationship to a bloody rare end.
On the very morning the sun rose like an overcooked egg yolk smeared across the tepid toast of the horizon, Bartholomew 'Danger' Crumb—armed with a damp map, a squeaky compass, and an unquenchable thirst for mild excitement—strode into the jungle of Certain Peril, where the vines whispered 'no refunds' and the mosquitoes wore his regret like cologne.
It was a bright and napless noon when Little Tilly Tiptoe (age seven-and-one-enthusiasm), clutching her emotionally supportive broccoli named Sir Florets-a-Lot, marched across the playground—really more of a geo-socio-sandbox—where the clouds, like overwashed socks, hung apologetically, and the swings squeaked lullabies that promised adventure, homework, and possibly juice.
It was a damp and pun-gent evening when Detective Cole Slaw, tossed from the force for dressing poorly, romaine'd calm while he stalked the saucy killer through the seedy bar, a dive so low the pickles were in a jarred state and the patrons were bread to loaf and wurst to ketchup.
When the mortician-turned-baker decided to raise the dead dough, the stakes—steaks?—were high, and though he kneaded closure he just couldn't meat expectations, so he loafed about making grave rye-marks, custardy glances at buns intended, grinding his feelings into the wurst bratwurst of emotions, which, to be frank, was a bologna excuse for living.
Her heart fluttered like a concussed pigeon in a velvet shoebox as Bradlynn—half barista, half billionaire, and all man—strode into the laundromat with a swagger that made the spin cycle blush, and in that moist, detergent-scented instant she knew destiny had slipped on a fabric softener sheet and fallen flat into her soul.
It was a lavender-scented dusk of destiny, when the sky—blushing like a debutante's overripe plum (or perhaps a bruised cherub's knee)—draped itself across the trembling town, and my heart, a rococo chandelier of feelings, tinkled with teardrops of molten velvet as fate tiptoed in wearing noisy slippers of silence and inevitability.
On the evening that the compass forgot north and the moon wore a smirk like a cracked dinner plate, Captain Brachio Thundershorn—famed in taverns he'd never visited—unfurled a treasure map so greasy with legend that even the jungle (which hates paper) winced, and declared, "Forward, probably," while the volcano cleared its throat politely.
It was a brisket evening when she briskly brisked in, a rare beauty with well-done intentions, searing my tenderloins until I felt my heart char-broiled and my morals cured, and though I'd sworn to cut ties, I found myself ham-fistedly staking my claim, because in the abattoir of love, you either fillet or be filet.
It was a binary and stormy epoch; the nebulae sobbed pixelated tears onto the rusted moon-boulevards of Neo-Hoboken as Captain Zax Throttlebody, whose eyes were the precise Pantone of hyperspace, adjusted his quantum fedora and rebooted destiny with a buttery sigh that smelled faintly of ionized regret.
It was a neon and vacuumy void, the stars blinking like lazy routers (cosmic Wi‑Fi, as the astrophysicists say) while Captain Nebula—whose jaw had more angles than a dodecahedron of sadness—gripped the sticky helm of the S.S. Epiphany, as time hiccuped, space yodeled, and destiny buffered at 3%, indefinitely, with ads.
It was a blisteringly tepid dawn when Captain Buck "Thunder" McGasket, whose chin could cut glass yet often only butter (unsalted), unfurled the moldy map he'd discovered behind his aunt's taxidermied iguana and vowed, with the gusto of a misfired cannon, to circumnavigate the Inland Desert Sea before lunch, or at least before brunch crumbs circumnavigated him.
Veronica felt her heart, that pinkish, heroic fist of destiny, hiccup like a moth with asthma trapped inside a mayonnaise jar as Bradwardine—whose eyes were the confusing color of reheated soup and whose jaw could chisel cheddar—strode through the revolving door, which turned and turned like love itself, squeaking in a register only souls can hear.
It was a dark and stormy quadrant; the stars dribbled like leaky faucets across the velvet void while Captain Nebula Jones, whose chin was as rugged as an asteroid with good skincare, rebooted the hyper-warp faster-than-light quantum engine with a romantic sigh, courageously clicking 'accept all cookies' on the galaxy's terms of service.
On the eve of the Magna Carta, when serfs scuttled like discount crabs beneath the velvet table of destiny, Sir Reginald of WiFi (so called because he connected to everyone) adjusted his chainmail necktie and tweeted, in quill, "Yea, verily," as thunder applauded like a slow-clapping monk with chilblains.
The moon, a languid custard of celestial yearning, slopped its golden sighs over the panicked marmalade skyline as my soul—bejeweled with porpoise-plated regrets and corseted by the velveteen whispers of fate—tiptoed through time's brocade vestibule, sneezing stardust like a perfumed cannon in a cathedral of moist, importunate echoes.
It was a quantum midnight on Mars, the kind that glitched the stars like buffering videos while red dust sneezed across the craters, and Captain Vance, whose jaw could cut tungsten, adjusted his gravity-fed feelings and prepared to upload his heart into the ship's sulking AI.
On a dim and storm-lashed space-night, as quantum rain drizzled sideways through the starboard porthole (a feature of budget warp-barges), Captain Nebula McAsteroid adjusted his anti-gravity epaulets and sighed heroically, for the universe had buffer overflowed again, deleting his past, future, and, most tragically, his carefully preheated dehydrated lasagna.
It was a damp noon pretending to be midnight as the city bled neon into puddles (the municipal kind, not the farm variety), and Detective Dirk Malmsey—whose trench coat held more secrets than his marriage and fewer donuts than his partner—squinted at the corpse (greenish, like an avocado left on read), deciding the killer was either left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous.
On the night the butcher was found minced, Detective Sir Loin—a man of rare taste who never missed a steak-out—grilled suspects until the prime suspect, a tender young fillet with a bloody past and a beef with everyone, confessed medium-awkwardly, saying he'd been framed by a ham-fisted plot that just didn't meat expectations.
It was a quantum and stormy midnight on Proxima-B, where the rain uploaded itself in torrents of wet data except when rebooted by solar flares that whooshed down the alleys of Dome 12, rattling recycled tin-sky panels and agitating the brave little oxygen lamps that heroically 3D-printed light against the unrelenting vacuum of destiny.
It was a gritty night in the city that never sweeps, when Detective Dirk Gravel—whose jaw was chiseled from mystery and coffee grounds—found the corpse of a millionaire philatelist (a stamp guy, for the uninitiated) lying like yesterday's mail on the rug, postmarked with a bullet; and the clue screamed in silence: return to sender, or else.
When the baker was murdered, the cops kneaded me to rise to the occasion, but I loafed around until the case got crusty, and only then did I roll with the punches, whisking through clues, sifting suspects, and proving the killer was the gluten for punishment kneading dough time.
It was a moist and indecisive morning; the jungle breathed like a damp accordion (played badly by destiny), as Captain Bramble McThorn, whose chin had its own zip code, unfurled the map tattooed on his inner eyelid—squinting heroically—toward a treasure so legendary that everyone sensible had forgotten it on purpose, including me, the narrator.
It was a humid night in the city that never remembers, and I, Dirk Malloy, private eye and part-time lactose intolerant, could smell crime like overcooked spaghetti on a radiator, especially after Mrs. VanDerSquint tottered in with tears like guilty diamonds, clutching a purse that screamed alibi louder than a siren with laryngitis.
It was a sweltering Tuesday of the heart when Desiree first noticed Chadwick, whose eyes were the color of uncommitted rainclouds over a parking lot sale, and as their gazes collided like two shopping carts in the produce aisle, destiny squeaked, apologized, and kept touching the same avocado until it felt something.
In the deli-cate town of Hamhock, where steaks were high and morals low, I mustard the courage to ketchup on the crime: someone had battered the sole proprietor, leaving no whey out, and now I was on a roll, kneading clues before they'd stale-mate the case.
It was a spiteful thyme in the city of Pastatropolis, where Detective Al Dente—fresh off a saucy case—was feeling penne-d up; his partner, the lactose-tolerant whey-f, cheesed him off with curd remarks, while the cereal killer left corny notes that grained on their nerves, barley believable and wholly wheaty, until everything went a-rye.
It was the year 1066-and-a-half, give or take, when Lady Mildred of the Future Past adjusted her creaking corset of destiny upon the muddy runway of history, while ravens cawed like unpaid interns and the Norman Wi-Fi (a rumor carried by monks with quills) buffered across England's greenish, envious bosom.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous Tuesday when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jawline was as chiseled as the budget cuts were deep, stalked the alley where a corpse lounged like yesterday's lasagna, while clues—shy, gluten-free creatures—hid under puddles pretending to be mirrors for the city's greasy conscience, as distant sirens yodeled like off-key canaries auditioning for a coal mine.
It was a soggy twilight of emotions when Brenda, whose eyes were the color of a freshly opened can of peas and twice as complex, fell in love with Todd during a shared umbrella catastrophe, their fingers grazing like two damp ferrets discovering electricity in a discount candle aisle.
It was a crime so heinous it should have been tried in pun-itive court, for when I, Inspector General Lee Speaking, arrived at the scene—a butchered baker beside a battered candlestick-maker—the air was thick with foul play-dough and whisk-takes, the victim having been kneaded, tenderized, and left with a note that said "roll with it," which, dough-biously, I couldn't baguette.
It was a bright and stormless epoch on Planet Nine, where the vacuum roared like a silent lion (because there's no air, duh), and Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum-pajama exosuit, which hugged him like a needy algorithm, while the spaceship, named The Subtle Anvil, tiptoed clumsily through hyperspace like a rhinoceros on rollerblades.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat hung from his shoulders like a damp accusation left out in the moral drizzle of the city, sipped coffee so black it confessed twice, while the corpse on the carousel kept going around in circles, refusing to cooperate except by pointing nowhere with rigor-mortised enthusiasm.
The sun sagged over Cactus Gulch like an old egg yolk on a dusty plate, while Sheriff Buckaroo McSpleen—whose stare could lasso a lie and whose mustache had its own zip code—spurred his three-legged mare toward the saloon, where the piano tinkled like tin cans and destiny waited, chewing tobacco and spelling it wrong.
Amid the soggy twilight of my heart's weather app, Clarissa thunderclapped into the café, her eyes like two Wi‑Fi routers blinking passion, and I knew, as surely as mayonnaise knows potato salad, that destiny—spelled D-E-S-T-I-KNEE—had kneed me in the feelings with cupid's damp, off-brand arrow.
On a night so voluptuously nocturnal that the darkness itself blushed, the moon poured its lactose luminescence over the quivering village like overcooked custard on a shivering trifle, while the wind—tipsy with secrets and garlic—waltzed through the chimneys, fondling the shingles and whispering promises so purple they stained the very air with melodious bruises.
When Sir Loin of Beefwell turned up in the walk-in, tenderized to a pun-chline, Detective Brie de Garda mustard her courage, ketchup with the evidence, and relished interrogating thyme-worn suspects—the crusty roll model, the saucy heiress with a chip on her shoulder, and the sole heir who smelt fishy—because somebody had a rare steak in this well-done crime.
It was a night so luxuriantly velvet that the moon, blushing like a debutante smothered in lavender talc, coyly veiled her gaze behind a filigree of clouds while the city, that perfumed dowager of brick and sighs, loosened its corset of cobblestones and breathed, oh breathed, a chandeliered exhalation of wistful, rhinestoned melancholy.
Under a sun so tired it yawned itself sideways behind a cactus that looked like a green fork stuck in God's uncooked steak, Sheriff Lamentation Boone clanked into Dead Mule Gulch, his spurs weeping rusty tears while tumbleweeds whispered legal advice, and vowed to clean up the town with his spotless, pearl-handled, notoriously inaccurate conscience.
It was a crime of passionfruit in the thyme of the season, where the sole survivor had no mussel left to clam up, and the suspect—an organ-ized villain with a bad kidney for humor and no liver to care—stated, colon: I came, I saw, I con-seeded, now lettuce never speak of it.
It was a thyme of grime in Punnsmouth, where Detective Cole Slaw—lettuce pray for him—stalked the cereal killer who left clues in bad taste: a garnish of crime scenes, a-ketchup note saying "relish the moment," and a victim named Olive (who didn't), proving once and for oil that murder is a dish best served cold-pressed.
It was a humid evening in the little town of Heartstring Falls when Desire (not to be confused with Lust, her younger sister who waitressed nights at the Waffle Barn) met Reginald, whose eyes were the color of printer jam, and their souls collided like two shopping carts on a squeaky linoleum aisle of Fate.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of opalescent melancholy, dribbled its syrupy gloom over the town like a sighing teapot, while my heart—an overripe pomegranate stuffed with sighs, sonnets, and slightly used doilies—throbbed with the thunderous quietude of destiny's velvet tap shoes on the catwalk of eternity.
On a Tuesday that felt like a million light-years of Monday, Captain Nebula McStarlace squinted through the ship's windshield (a metaphorical one—budget cuts), as the galaxy unfurled like a wrinkled aluminum taco, the quantum drive coughing politely while an AI with the charisma of a damp sock flirted with a wormhole shaped exactly like my ex's disappointed mouth.
On the opaline cusp of dawn, when the sun poured its marmalade lament over the doilied horizon like a tipsy chandelier weeping citrus tears, Esmeralda's heart—an overstuffed velvet fainting couch of yearning—swooned inside her ribcage conservatory as destiny tottered in on brocade boots, tracking puddles of perfumed inevitability across the shag carpet of eternity.
It was a moist and morally ambiguous evening when I, Detective Dirk Gristle, slithered into the crime scene like a fedora with legs, my trench coat perspiring confidence while the sirens sobbed like bagpipes in a blender, and the corpse (apparently murdered to death) lay sprinkled with clues as obvious as Sudoku but twice as unsolved.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat hung on him like a weary beige thundercloud (size 42 long, dry-clean only), knew the corpse was dead—very dead—because it lay in a puddle of its own blood like ketchup at a diner murder special, and also because his keen eyes, blue as alibis, noticed the missing head.
The moon, a lascivious custard tart slathered upon the sable tablecloth of the heavens, dribbled its pallid gravy over the village roofs, while my heart—opulent as a velvet ottoman abandoned in a perfume shop—throbbed with the sort of destiny only truly gifted sufferers can afford to misinterpret.
It was a dark and stormy knight, having mailed it in with his chain letters and posted guard, when Detective Al Dente arrived to find the pasta-tute rigoroni, the crime grate and in bad taste, a truly dis-aster case, since the sole witness had cold feet and was, alas, de-feeted.
Captain Barnaby Thunderpants set his jaw like a stubborn clam at low tide as the map tattooed on his left buttock (don't ask, yet) tingled ominously, pointing him toward the kind of jungle where compasses run away to join the circus, parrots speak in riddles they don't understand, and destiny itself trips over a root and faceplants into legend.
It was a dusty and suspiciously heroic noon when Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit rode into Cactus Junction on a horse that smelled like hot coins and regret (the horse, not the Junction), spurs chiming like unfaithful wedding bells while tumbleweeds fled in legally-binding terror before his gaze, which holstered bullets the way clouds holster thunder.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart of destiny, slumped over the mauve horizon as my heart, a candelabra of yearning with several bulbs unhelpfully flickering, exhaled polysyllabic sighs into the velvet-flavored night, while destiny, wearing squeaky galoshes of inevitability, tiptoed through puddles of yesterday's perfume to serenade my trembling, melodramatic elbows.
Detective Dirk Mallardy, whose trench coat clung to him like a guilty alibi in a rainstorm that forgot the rain, surveyed the crime scene—a room full of clues so obvious they were practically screaming in lowercase—while his pistol smoked like a Sunday ham and the corpse failed, quite suspiciously, to deny everything.
It was a bright and stormless morning in the town of Tiddlywink, where the sun gushed like lukewarm applesauce onto the playground and little Timmy, aged precisely seven-and-a-half and three-sixteenths, trudged heroically to kindergarten with a backpack heavier than destiny and a nose heroically committed to exploration, which is to say picking, mining, and the occasional archaeological excavation.
The moon, a weeping custard saucer spilled across the velvet soufflé of night, sighed its buttery luminance onto the trembling village, where windows, like bashful eyelashes glued to brick cheeks, fluttered in the wind's perfumed gossip, and my heart, a sequin-studded hamster wheel of destiny, squeaked toward the ever-blossoming catastrophe of love.
In the nebulaic evening of Sector 12B—humid with photons and smelling faintly of burnt Wi‑Fi—the star-rain sloshed against the dome of New Boise like wet glitter in God's snow globe, while Captain Tragg (past: classified; future: backordered) rebooted destiny by unplugging the universe, counting to ten, and jamming the cosmic USB in upside down, twice.
It was a crime so heinous that even the shadows filed a complaint, and as Detective Dirk Gravel (whose jawline could sand teak and whose trench coat smelled faintly of alibi) minced through the rain like a suspicious swan, he realized the victim—a billionaire philatelist of some repute—had been murdered twice, first by death and then by poor taste.
It was a crime of passion fruit, the kind that left the whole town in a jam, for when baker Al Dente was found bread and butter side down beside the rolling pin, suspicion rose like yeast and tempers floured, while I, the sole investigator, vowed to whisk away doubts and cut to the quiche of the batter.
Once upon a time in the squeakiest part of the refrigerator-colored town of Butterbean, little Timmy Twinkletoes, aged seven and three-eighths (which is practically eight, if you round up like the mayor does with taxes), discovered friendship, morality, and a suspiciously talkative puddle that smelled like homework and destiny mushed together like overripe bananas.
It was a grave night in the cemetery district, where the undertaker had been buried in work until he coffin-ed up the truth, and I, a beleaguered reporter ink-lined to misprint, felt my spirits type-set in bold, italic despair as the plot thickened like cold gravy on a murdered roast, rare but well done.
It was a grave morning at the morgue café, where the cereal killer sat across from me with a bowl of Cheer-eeries, liver alone and don't kidney me, he spleened, in a vein attempt at artery, but I had the gall to stomach it, ribbed for my displeasure, having the intestines fortitude to digest his offal jokes.
It was 1066, or thereabouts, give or take a millennium, when the tapestry of destiny—hand-stitched by nuns with calloused thumbs and questionable color palettes—unraveled across the moors like a damp duvet, as Sir Nigel Wi-Fi de Breadcrumbs checked the runes (and his vibes) and declared history ready to load, buffering valiantly beneath a drizzle.
It was a humid twilight (the kind that makes curtains cling like needy lovers to windows, which is appropriate, considering) when Claribel's heart, already wearing a seatbelt because of prior incidents, rear-ended destiny's bumper in the roundabout of love, scattering the delicate turn signals of propriety like rose petals flung by a tipsy flower girl.
It was a time of cutlery and missteaks, when Sir Loin, a beefy baron with a tender past and rare prospects, found himself grilled by fate, salted by doubt, and marinated in sheer siren-dipity, while his ex, Patty O'Furniture, sat on the edge, chairishing memories and ketchuping on old flames that were, frankly, the wurst.
The moon, a lachrymose custard of celestial melancholy, dribbled its opalescent sorrow upon the quivering cobblestones, where my heart—an overwrought hedgehog wrapped in velvet sighs—performed a foxtrot with doom while the night exhaled perfumed shadows thick as overripe plums fermenting in the larynx of eternity.
It was the kind of murder that sneaks up on a city like a cat in tap shoes—loud yet stealthy—when Detective Dirk Gristle, whose eyes were as hard-boiled as the eggs he ate for alibis, sniffed the crime scene (a studio apartment redder than a librarian's blush) and deduced, from the missing doormat, that nothing here was on the level.
Detective Dirk Muddleflap knew the case was busted wide open like a piñata at a funeral when he found the smoking gun wearing lipstick, the alibi sagging like wet lasagna, and the city around him a jigsaw missing all four corners while rain served regret-flavored soup and the victim lay deader than dial-up.
Love crashed into Mildred like a swan-shaped paddleboat hitting the pier at closing time, splintering her heart into souvenir keychains, while Brad, whose eyes were the color of inspirational posters about perseverance, exhaled cologne and destiny, promising forever in the same tone he used to order gluten-free breadsticks, which, like his vows, came lukewarm yet surprisingly oily.
The prairie yawned like a tired buffalo rug under a sky ironed flat by the merciless noon, while Sheriff Cactus McGloom (so called because his hugs were hypothetical) jingled into Dustpan Gulch on a horse named Maybe, whose eyes, like two overcooked beans, surveyed the horizon for trouble, romance, or coupons.
Moonlight dribbled onto the cobblestones like overcooked porridge, while my heart, a mangy hummingbird stuffed inside a velvet sock, thwacked against the cathedral of my ribcage, and destiny—perfumed with the musk of yesterday's rain and Aunt Petunia's regret—waltzed in wearing squeaky shoes, tracking muddy footprints across the pristine Persian rug of my trembling soul.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart bleeding silver onto the weeping cobblestones of my destiny, sighed through the chiffon curtains of eternity as I, a tempest-tossed chandelier of feelings and elbows, sashayed into the velvet-bludgeoned night, where every raindrop wrote a sonnet on my pores and the stars applauded with damp, apologetic jazz-hands.
It was a moist and swooning evening when Mildred first beheld Lance at the discount candle aisle, his eyes like two overcooked olives floating in the martini of fate, and her heart, a damp handkerchief of longing, fluttered as though wrung out by Cupid's arthritic, ketchup-stained fingers.
At high noon, which was low in spirit like a depressed sundial, I, Captain Buckle McThistle, clutched the moldy map that smelled like a wet dog's dream and vowed to find the Lost Volcano of Ice, while the compass spun like gossip at a pirate PTA and the jungle flung vines like spaghetti from an angry chef.
It was the kind of evening when the moon, a perspiring pearl rolling in the velvet gravy of the heavens, sighed perfumed starlight onto the trembling town, while my heart—an overripe mango in a brass corset—oozed destiny across the cobblestones with a squelch both dignified and moist.
It was a damp and morally moist evening when I, Detective Dirk Gravel, slithered into the crime like a buttered eel into a sock drawer, the corpse reclining on the linoleum with all the élan of a broken lawn chair, while the suspect's alibi—flimsy as decaf coffee—winked at me with gums where teeth ought to have been.
It was a dawn both crackling and moist as a breakfast cereal left in the rain, when Captain Buck Flintbeard, whose eyes were two maps no cartographer could fold, hoisted his wheezing backpack and vowed to conquer the Uncharted Jungle (located just past the Definitely Charted Gift Shop), destiny squeaking in his damp socks.
Captain Barnaby Throttlewhistle, whose jaw was chiselled like a melted iceberg and whose courage smelled faintly of pineapple, squinted at the map tattooed on the inside of his eyelids as the jungle desert ocean spread before him in all directions, roaring like a whisper, while destiny—late as usual—tripped over a treasure chest and landed face-first into his unfolding legend.
Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more coffee than crime scenes and whose mustache resembled a chalk outline of a caterpillar, knew the city was guilty ever since the fog confessed to him at 3:07 a.m., whispering through the alley like a leaky accordion with trust issues and garlic breath.
It was a crime to be scene, I mused, as I mustard the courage to ketchup with the saucy culprit who relished his role, a seasoned ham whose alibi was full of baloney, and though I was loaf to admit it, my buns were toasted and my spirits pickled by his briny wit.
Moonlight dribbled like melted pearls over the velveteen cobblestones of my heart, which, being a boulevard shaped like a question mark dipped in marmalade, quivered with the kind of trembling only violins and unlicensed small earthquakes know, while destiny, that damp swan in a tutu of fog, preened its foreboding feathers at my window.
It was a crime of passionfruit, the kind that left the city in pulp friction, as Detective Hammett Rye (a hard roll to swallow) stalked the seedy underbelly where stakes were rare, morals were well done, and every lead was baloney—until the suspect spilled his beans and got canned for good measure.
It was a moist evening of destiny when Clarabella's heart, a trembling croissant fresh from the oven of fate, buttered itself on the jamb of Sir Percival's gaze; and as the rain sobbed like a cello with allergies over the cobblestones (European!), their souls collided with the tender crunch of two Doritos in a velvet purse, sparking crumbs of forever.
It was a dry and thirsty dusk in Cactus Knife Gulch when Sheriff Nebuchadnezzar "Neb" McGrit rode into town on a horse as nervous as a mouse at a barn cat jamboree, his spurs jangling like tin thunder and his past dragging behind him like a sunburned tumbleweed with commitment issues, seeking justice, or coffee, whichever came first.
The moon, that pallid custard tart of the heavens, oozed its lachrymose light upon the hamlet like spilled perfume on an unbearded duke, while my heart, a trembling hedgehog in a velvet sock, quivered at the susurrant whispers of destiny, which smelled faintly of lilacs, old coins, and grandmother's scandalously perfumed umbrella.
It was a bleak thyme in the city, when I, a loafly gumshoe who kneaded dough to survive, took on a cereal killer case so corny it made me tear in tiers; the steaks were high, the plot gravy-thickened, and every clue was seasoned with assault and battery, but I mustard the courage—olive you, noir.
It was a daring and moderately humid dawn when Captain Thaddeus Brambletoe, clutching a tea-stained treasure map that squinted back at him like a suspicious omelet, vowed to conquer the unmappably mapless Isle of Peril; his compass spun like gossip, his boots squeaked like offended manatees, and the volcano politely burped foreshadowing.
On the eve of destiny's yawn, when the moon dripped mayonnaise over the marmoreal rooftops and time itself pouted like a lipstick-smeared cherub, my heart—an overripe avocado of yearning—throbbed petulantly beneath a corset of sighs as the city exhaled perfumed thunder, wooing my destiny with rhubarb whispers and chandeliered raindrops.
It was a heroic sort of afternoon, the kind that makes a man tighten his bootlaces and a llama reconsider its life choices, when Captain Dirk Barnacle, clutching a damp, mayonnaise-stained map that smelled like destiny and old sandwiches, vowed to discover the Sunken Mountain located inland at sea, where his compass spun like a panicked hamster and the jungle practiced whispering ominously
It was the kind of murder that sneaks up on you like a past-due rent bill—unexpected, damp, and splashed with red ink—when I, Dirk Mallory, licensed detective and unlicensed philosopher, sloshed into a moonlit alley where sirens wailed like bagpipes strangling geese, my trench coat beige as betrayal and gravy, and my heel skidded on a banana-shaped clue that screamed, in block capitals, MOTIVE.
It was a moist and wistful twilight when Desiree, whose eyes were the approximate color of emotionally complicated dishwater, met Lance on Aisle 7 between the bargain laxatives and the wilted roses, and their hearts tangoed like damp mops wrung by destiny, squeaking out a love so epic that even the automatic doors sighed.
When Daphne, a lactose-intolerant dairy heiress with whey too much time, caught her boyfriend Cheddar in a compromising rind‑ezvous with Brie in the whey house, she curdn't believe her eyes, felt utterly buttered, and swore she'd milk the moment for all it was worth, even if her scheme went a‑gouda‑ry.
It was the year 1588, give or take a fortnight depending on the Pope's calendar correction, when young Percival Thatch, whose chinstrap beard was as aspirational as England's navy, strode through a London fog thick as pottage and twice as moral, vowing to avenge his father (recently deceased of historically accurate humors) with a quill, a codpiece, and destiny.
It was a high noon that dragged its boots across the sky, scuffing the sun into a cracked egg, while tumbleweeds tangoed like lonely corsages and Sheriff Buck's spurs jangled hymns to justice, which was slower than his horse, faster than his temper, and about as reliable as a cactus canteen.
When Percival first beheld Clarissa across the gluten-free muffin aisle of the MegaMart (aisle seven, near the discount batteries), his heart detonated like a confetti cannon at a kindergarten graduation, spewing feelings that smelled faintly of lilac-scented regret, and he knew, with the certainty of a malfunctioning GPS, that destiny had recalculated: "Proceed to cuddle," in 300 uncertain feet.
It was a dark and stormy vacuum, the kind of night that space has when the nebula forgets its makeup, and as the S.S. Epiphany II creaked through the glittering nothing (for it is in the Andromeda laundromat that our scene spins), its captain adjusted his laser monocle and pondered, with algorithmic melancholy, whether time travel could fix his divorce or at least the coffee.
It was a humid Tuesday of the heart when Mildred's love crashed into Lionel like a shopping cart into a pyramid of canned yams, sending her feelings tumbling end over end and denting his soul's label, while moonbeams (though it was noon) dripped like mascara on a clown, sealing their destiny with a sneeze that sounded suspiciously like "forever."
It was on a humid Tuesday that Dirk Thunderpants, whose biceps had their own zip codes, unfurled a map so old it smelled like grandma's attic and destiny, only to realize it was upside down, which explained the north-pointing south, the talking compass with trust issues, and the volcano politely clearing its throat.
The moon, a perspiring pearl loitering in a velvet bruise of sky, sobbed its mayonnaise light upon the town, where my heart—an overripe avocado of ache—spread itself upon the toast of destiny, while the wind, perfumed like old wallpaper, fluttered my soul's curtains with a faint yet thunderous whisper of forever.
It was a thyme of grave-y peril when I, a wry-rye writer with no moral compunctions but plenty of cumin sense, met my sole-mate at the pier—our meet-cute turned meat-cute as I fell head over eels, smitten to the core like an apple-ology, and knew, in my hart of darkness, we were mint to brie, for cheddar or for wurst.
When Bradshaw thundered into the laundromat like a cologne storm in tight jeans, Clarissa felt her heart swoon, trip, and file a liability claim, for love, that fickle soufflé of destiny, rose in her chest then collapsed with a hiss as he mispronounced her name as "Clarinet" and asked for quarters.

When Detective Al Dente arrived at the noodle crime scene, he felt pasta point of no return, for the victim was sauced beyond recognition, the culprit left a penne dreadful note saying "you cannoli blame yourself," and the case would take thyme, bay leaves, and no small measure of sheer basilisk courage.
When Sir Loin was found butchered in the Ribald District, Inspector Brie, a cultured cop with a cheddared past, swore to grill the prime suspect to the bone, but as the stakes rose and the plot thickened like lumpy gravy, every clue was half-baked and the alibi was, quite frankly, baloney.
Detective Lance Gravel, whose trench coat hung from his shoulders like a defeated beige flag (dry-clean only, receipt missing), squinted through the venetian blinds at a city with more secrets than a priest's sock drawer while the corpse on his carpet politely declined comment, bleeding confetti of clues that spelled—if you squinted harder—'maybe.'
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jaw was as square as a Sudoku box missing all the numbers, knew the murder was an inside job because the victim, a millionaire philatelist allergic to air, was found outside, inside the alley, with a postage stamp stuck to his back that screamed "silence" in whispery capital letters.
It was a crime so tasteless the town could barely stomach it: a cereal killer on the loose, leaving notes written in thyme about murder most fowl, which ruffled feathers and romained unsolved until I, a rye-and-wry gumshoe with a ham-handed past, decided to baguette about it and lettuce prey for grate expectations.

It was a thyme of great peril in Parsley City, where I, private rye, was on a roll, loafing around the seedy baguette of town until a dame with a croissant to bear buttered me up with a jam-packed tale that spread thin, and I kneaded the dough—case closed-casket, open sesame, in mayo-hem where lettuce pray was the salad consolation.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; the rain fell in tachyons—except at occasional intervals, when a clumsy warp-gust burped through the quantum cul-de-sacs of Sector 12 (for it is in Space that our story hangs), rattling asteroid shingles and coquettishly tickling the emergency glowworms that bravely pretended to be stars.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart drooling silver gravy upon the velveteen bosom of the quivering night, sighed like a lovesick accordion as my heart, a jeweled anvil wrapped in lavender despair, clanged tenderly against destiny's doily, scattering perfumed whimpers across the boulevard of sighs like wistful confetti soaked in nostalgic thunder.
It was a gloaming of velveteen melancholies, when the moon perspired pearls onto the quivering pavement and my heart, a baroque soufflé of yearning and adjectives, rose and collapsed simultaneously like a swan-dive into a teaspoon, while destiny, wearing too much perfume, tiptoed loud as thunder through the chiffon corridors of my soul.
It was love at first blunder when Clarissa, whose eyes were the exact color of freshly microwaved peas, collided hearts-first with Bernard at the discount candle aisle, where the waxy scent of 'Ocean Regret' swirled around them like destiny's sweaty armpit, and their souls, like two damp socks, clung together in static-cling eternity.
It was a noon so high and lonesome the sun fried the sky like an overcooked egg in a rusty skillet, when Sheriff Lint Pickens rode into Misfire Gulch on a horse uglier than a boiled boot and twice as nervous, his spurs jingling like guilty consciences while tumbleweeds applauded and coyotes sang off-key hymns of impending paperwork.

The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping glycerin onto the velvet soufflé of night, gazed upon Percival (for that was his name), as he strode like a brooding swan through the garlic-scented alley of destiny, clutching his memories—moist, incandescent, and unusually foldable—while the stars applauded with brittle eyelids that creaked like antique cucumbers.
On the night the butchered baron was found tenderized, Detective Sir Loin—no mere chump, though people ribbed him—grilled the suspects medium-hard, chewing over their rare alibis until the plot thickened like gravy, and he realized the culprit was kneaded all along: his dough-eyed fiancé, who couldn't keep her yeast to herself and loafed around with every crumb bum in town.
It was a neon and asteroid-pelted midnight on Planet 7-Eleven, where the binary moons glared like unpaid parking tickets and Captain Vortex McNebula, half-cyborg, half-mistake, adjusted his quantum mustache while the ship's AI, named Mom, nagged the warp drive for backtalk and coupons.
In the Year of Our Lord 1066, when knights wore chainmail like jangly pajamas and England (a quaint suburb of Europe) waited for a delivery of destiny that arrived late due to inclement Normans, I, Mildred the Mostly, sharpened my quill-sword to diary the invasion, which history would later thank me for by forgetting.
It was a dark and stormy knight, mail damp and morale chain-linked, when I, Sir Cumference, rounded the corner only to find the princess in a pickle that was clearly cucumbersome: the dill perpetrator had left no thyme, only a note that read 'lettuce romaine silent,' which I took with a grain of assaulted battery.
It was a moist midnight in Gristleburg when Detective Dirk Grackle (whose jaw could staple wallpaper) found the corpse sprawled like yesterday's laundry across the mayor's koi pond, the moon confessing to the water in shimmering squeaks while sirens coughed nearer, and I knew—being his partner and prime suspect—that the case had closed around us like a broken zipper.

It was a sunny sort of gloom, the flavor of Wednesday pudding clinging to the sky like a damp Band-Aid, when Timmy Tiddlewink, age seven-and-three-quarters (an age both fierce and educational), decided, with a hero's belch and a pocket of lukewarm raisins, to teach the melancholy moon proper manners.
When Detective Ham Lettuce, a seasoned romain of the force, found the butchered baker in the flour, he knew he kneaded answers, but the case kept rolling, crust me, into a crumby trail of stale suspects—yeast of all a buttered-up widow whose alibi was wafer-thin and whose tears were clearly for show-dough.
It was a damply moonlit midnight in the smoldering ruins of Castle Clatterbane when the prophecy (the Deluxe Edition with gilded margins and typos) finally hatched like a nervous egg, oozing dread and glitter, while Sir Dribble the Unready tiptoed heroically past the growling goblin-dragon-werewolf thingy that smelled like wet parchment and yesterday's nightmares.

It was a clue-ridden evening in Gristle City, and I, Dirk Blot—private investigator, amateur philatelist, and full-time sufferer of destiny—tiptoed into the crime scene like a cat in sensible shoes, where the corpse lay extremely deceased, bleeding burgundy like a pretentious wine, whispering nothing except everything I didn't want to hear.
It was a muggy night in the city (my city, though it never sent me a thank-you card), when the corpse strolled into my office by failing to stroll anywhere at all, collapsing like a lasagna of secrets on my rug, which tied the room together and, coincidentally, the case, with marinara-red clues.
It was a bold and blustery dawn when Captain Buck Thunderclap—whose jaw could open cans and whose past was whispered about by parrots with eyepatches—unfurled his map so wrinkled it looked like the ocean's laundry, vowing to find the Lost Volcano of Ice before breakfast or die trying after lunch, whichever scheduled first.
It was a damp alibi of a night, the kind that fogs up a man's conscience like a cheap bathroom mirror, and as I adjusted my trench coat—soggy as lasagna forgotten in a birdbath—I knew the corpse on Pier 13 was innocent, unlike the footprints, which were definitely guilty.
It was the best of times to be Henry VIII's barber, and the wurst of times for his wives (who, unlike sausages, could not be re-stuffed once extruded), as London, wearing a fog like a moth-eaten ermine, queued its plaguey breath around the Thames, which snaked lazily like a whipped eel beneath history's unblinking monocle.

It was a dry and dusty noon; the tumbleweeds tumbled with the insouciance of debutantes at a barn cotillion—except when a vengeful breeze, smelling of beans and destiny, bullied them against the saloon's splintered veranda, where Sheriff Cactus Jim, whose spurs jingled like nervous wedding bells, squinted heroically into the sun until it blinked first.
The velvet night, swaddled in hyperventilating constellations, exhaled perfumed doom upon the trembling cobblestones, while my heart, a baroque candelabrum dripping waxy epiphanies, pirouetted like a wounded swan across the tepid lake of destiny, whose ripples—jeweled sighs in brocade boots—whispered my ineffable, ineluctable, inexpressibly purple fate.
The moon gushed like a wounded pearl across the velvet-lipped heavens, sobbing its opalescent mayonnaise onto the town's sighing shingles, while my heart, a baroque accordion stuffed with lavender sighs and regretful muffins, wheezed destiny into the chandeliered night that twinkled like expensive dandruff on eternity's unbrushed shoulders.
On the morning when Napoleon met his Waterloo (directions obtained from a peasant with the face of a well-used baguette), the sun rose like a reprimanded soufflé over the quivering fields, while my great-great-possibly-great aunt Désirée tightened her corset of destiny and resolved to change history using only her eyebrows and a mildly seditious quill.
It was a ye olde morning in Rome (or was it Carthage? maps were unreliable then), when Consul Publius—fresh from inventing democracy and a hangover—strode across the Forum like a colossus made of poorly baked bread; the pigeons saluted, the senators trembled, and history itself pressed snooze, again, again, inexorably.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping mayonnaise light onto the quivering cobblestones of destiny, sighed through the accordion of the night as my heart—an overripe mango of yearning, bruised by fate's elbow—pulsed like a wounded chandelier, dripping sentiments in rococo rivulets that spelled, in cursive thunder, the ineffable marmalade of my soul.
The moon, a lachrymose custard ladled across the velveteen empyrean, wept buttery luminescence upon my soul's veranda as the night exhaled jasmine sighs through the keyholes of eternity, and I, trembling like a harpsichord in a thunderstorm of velvet bees, realized destiny's chandelier had winked at me with ten thousand rhinestone eyelashes.
It was a dark and stormy nebula; plasma drizzled like lukewarm soup over the creaking hull of the Starship Irreparable, whose captain, Commodore Flaxseed Q.

It was a dank and stormy knave as the butcher, clearly a cut above suspicion, met the saucy heiress at the organ harvest festival, where he livered a speech that butchered grammar, minced meanings, and, in a final tender loin of passion, proposed they meat forever, come what mayhem, till death due parse did them part.
High noon oozed across the prairie like lukewarm gravy on a chipped diner plate as Sheriff Buckle McGrit, whose mustache was wider than the horizon and twice as dusty, jingled into the town of Dry Gulch—where the tumbleweeds coughed, the cacti leaned in to gossip, and even the sun seemed to squint suspiciously at itself.
Clarissa knew it was destiny, or at least indigestion, when Brad's eyes—two lukewarm cappuccinos with skim—stirred her heart like a spoon in a toilet bowl, and the moon, swollen like an overripe zit, popped its tender light over the parking lot where their souls parallel-parked into each other's fender-benders.
Upon the velvet-brocaded bosom of the evening, swollen with mauve sighs and perfumed with the melancholic musk of yesteryear's rain, my soul—draped in brocade, too, but threadbare at the elbows of destiny—tiptoed across the moon's damp parquet, where stars perspired like bashful chandeliers and silence yodeled in lilac italics.
With the swagger of a compass pointing bravely southward and the map clenched in his teeth like a dog reluctant to fetch destiny's damp stick, Percival Thatch strode into the jungle's yawning welcome mat, where vines hissed like unboiled spaghetti and drums beat the nervous heart of a world that had misplaced its pulse.
Captain Bartholomew "Thunderpants" McGinty adjusted his soggy map with the gravitas of a walrus not quite ready for ballet class as the jungle breathed hot soup at him and the volcano yawned like an indifferent dragon, promising treasure, betrayal, and chafing in regions no compass has the decency to chart.
It was a moist and bewildered evening, and Desire—wearing a trench coat three sizes too big and smelling faintly of microwave lasagna—stumbled into Clarissa's heart like a clumsy barista into a revolving door, spilling lukewarm destiny everywhere and whispering, "No returns," while thunder applauded like an off-brand microwave popcorn bag bravely refusing to finish popping.
It was a moist and perspiring dusk when Clarabelle's heart, which had been hermetically sealed like last Tuesday's leftover lasagna, burped open at the sight of Brad's chin--heroic, cleft like a parking lot pothole--and she knew, as surely as perfume knows a discount rack, that destiny had finally friend-zoned her loneliness.
As the guillotine gleamed like a freshly polished conscience (rare in Paris this season), Citizen Véronique adjusted her tricorne—borrowed, like most ideals, from someone taller—and marched through a marmalade of fog toward Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity (listed here in order of availability), while the drums, overcooked by zeal, beat the egg whites of dawn into a stiff, trembling peak.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose chin had solved more cases than his brain ever could, stood over the victim like a question mark with a hangover, sniffing the crime scene as if it were a leftover burrito, while raindrops committed suicide on the widow's pane and the city confessed nothing but puddles.
History sneezed loudly in the year of our Lord 1066, spraying its frothy destiny across England's freshly laundered tapestry as Lady Mildred of Somewhere-or-Other (a maiden as delicate as a trebuchet but twice as accurate) sashayed toward Hastings in a rustling gown of chainmail chiffon, vowing to tweet—by carrier pigeon—whatever happened next.
It was a lavender-scented twilight of silken melancholy, when the moon (a pearl dropped by some clumsy celestial dowager) lolled like a bored eyelid over the hoity-toity rooftops, and my heart—oh, my tragic, taffeta-wrapped heart—clattered like a jeweled teacup on the saucer of destiny, spilling sugared sobs onto fate's fainting chaise.
It was a dark, rainy noon that felt like midnight wearing sunglasses, and Detective Lance Gravel—whose trench coat had seen more coffee than justice—stared at the corpse that was only mostly dead, like my alimony payments, while the femme fatale smoked a cigarette that cried smoke like a widow and said nothing suspicious very loudly.
Once upon a time at precisely 7:03 a.m., when good boys and girls brush their molars clockwise and the sun rises like a buttery pancake (gluten-free, in case of dragons with sensitivities), little Timmy Tiptoe discovered, with the seriousness of a potato wearing spectacles, that his feelings were missing, except for the itchy one.
Like a peacock drowning in a puddle of ink, the evening unfurled its sable eyelashes across the whimpering village, where chimneys sighed perfumes of regret and the moon, bashful as a debutante with spinach in her teeth, draped itself over the cathedral like a clingy shawl knitted by Time's arthritic aunt.
It was love at first squint, the kind that hits you like a velvet sledgehammer dipped in fondue, when Delilah—whose eyes were the color of freshly microwaved spinach and whose sighs sounded like a deflating air mattress—glided into the laundromat and spin-cycled my heart's delicates into a tangled, steaming knot.
It was a night so extravagantly nocturnal that the moon smeared its buttery sorrow over the soufflé of heavens, while my heart, a fainting chaise lounge upholstered in regrets, reclined in the parlor of destiny, sipping tepid sighs from a chipped teacup of fate that rattled like perfumed thunder.
Her love crashed into me like a dirigible made of cupcakes—sweet but suffocating—as I, Chadwick von Moist, gazed across the discount candle aisle (lavender, regret, and melted plastic mingling like our destinies) and knew that destiny, that flirtatious raccoon, had dug through my heart's trash and left everything sticky.
It was a night so quiet you could hear a crime think, and I, Detective Dirk Gravel, sat in my office like a lonely stapler on a cluttered desk when trouble knocked with lipstick knuckles, leaving a smear of mystery thicker than gravy on the plate of justice I hadn't even ordered yet.
Detective Dirk Gristle, whose trench coat hung heavier than his conscience which was actually very light because he hadn't done anything wrong (yet), squelched into the crime scene like a wet waffle iron during monsoon happy hour, where a corpse lay as dead as last season's avocado toast, whispering clues louder than a mime with cymbals.
On the twelfth midnight of the thirteenth moon, when the castle's shadows yawned like sleepy crocodiles in velvet tuxedos, Princess Gloomsbane (who was ironically allergic to gloom) tiptoed across the cobwebbed ballroom toward the ancient prophecy toaster, from which popped a slice of destiny buttered with screams and lightly sprinkled with the cinnamon of inevitable doom.
It was a velvet-tongued twilight, slathered with yearning like butter on the burnt toast of destiny, where the moon, a pallid custard saucer, wept glissandos of silver upon the quivering cobblestones as my heart—oh reckless tambourine of tender calamity—pouted, pirouetted, and exploded into a confetti of sighs beneath the chandeliered hush of eternity.
On a night so dark the moon wore sunglasses and the wind squealed like a kettle full of banshees (which, incidentally, I keep for tea), Sir Thaddeus Gloomwhistle—half-orphan, quarter-wizard, and full-time lactose intolerant—unsealed the prophecy jar, releasing a dragon-shaped smell and a mildew-colored scream that dripped across the castle like haunted gravy.
On the night the butcher met his filet of fate, the stakes were rare, the thyme was of the essence, and I, a tender-loin detective with a heart in sirloin condition, saw the prime suspect ketchup to a saucy alibi, knowing if I couldn't meat the culprit, I'd be grounded, minced, and seasoned with bitter regrets.
The moon, a languid pearl drooling mayonnaise light upon the bosomy clouds, sighed through the nostrils of night as Reginald, whose eyes were twin hurricanes trapped in teacups, tiptoed across the velvet sigh of the veranda, where roses perspired perfume like guilty secrets and destiny itself hiccuped, embarrassed by its own opulent inevitability.
In the year of our Lord 1066—give or take a fortnight, because calendars were wobbly then—the air above Hastings was thick with destiny (and other airborne particulates), as Sir Nigel of Somewhere-Else adjusted his chafing hauberk like a man girding his loins for a Yelp review, while history, fussy and flatulent, queued politely to be made.
It was in the damp deli of Grimchester, where the steaks were high and spirits low, that I, a cut-above gumshoe, found myself in a pickle: a baloney alibi thin enough to see through yet thick enough to mustard an arrest, while the butcher suspect couldn't meat expectations and took a cleaver approach.
It was an evening so mauve with melancholy that even the moon, that bashful custard of the cosmos, curdled behind chiffon clouds, while my heart—an overripe pomegranate of destiny—dripped ruby rumors into the teacup of fate, whose saucer, cracked like the smile of an aunt you never loved, trembled beneath the saucy teaspoon of time.
Madeline's heart, a microwaved croissant of desire, flaked apart as Bradford strode into the discount florist like a thundercloud in cologne, his gaze butterknifing through her soul's margarine, and in that moment she knew love was a coupon expiring at midnight, a buy-one-get-one fate she couldn't return without a receipt.
Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat smelled like yesterday's coffee trying to remember tomorrow, strode into the crime scene where the victim lay as murdered as a garden gnome in a bowling alley, while clues—shy as librarians at a disco—hid in the corners, snickering at justice's untied shoelaces.
Night sloshed over the city like week-old coffee on a sofa, and I, Lance Gravel, wrung myself out of a trench coat damp enough to need oars to gaze upon the body—a mystery inside an enigma inside a rain poncho—while the sirens meowed and clues leapt like turtles: a lipstick, a footprint, and an alibi smell stronger than stale donuts.
It was a giggly morning in Tiddlywink Town, where the sun beamed like a well-behaved flashlight your aunt says you can borrow if you promise not to run, and little Tommy-Tammy (who was at once five, nearly six, and spiritually four-and-a-half) set forth to discover friendship, responsibility, and possibly pudding, weather permitting.
Space, that big black soup of star-noodles, belched forth the USS Intrepidacious as Captain Nebula Jones adjusted his quantum-fedora and squinted heroically into the hyperdimensional fog, where time hiccuped like a drunk chronometer and the ship's AI, S.U.E., sultrily announced in Morse emojis that the galaxy's last planet had unfriended us with extreme prejudice.
It was a humid alibi of a night, the kind that sweats secrets like a gym sock in a confessional, when Detective Dirk Hardcastle, whose jaw could cut cheese and often did, found the corpse of Mayor Puddington reclining uncooperatively on the city fountain, stabbed by what appeared to be a very guilty breadstick.
It was a moist, destiny-laden afternoon when Clarissa's heart, a microwaved marshmallow stuffed into a rusted suit of armor, slumped sideways for Brad—whose eyes were two unlicensed swimming pools of sapphire chlorine—while the wind, which might have been Fate if Fate wore Axe body spray and clearance-rack sincerity, caressed their tax-deductible souls.
On the cusp of dawn—which resembled evening wearing a knockoff sunrise—Captain Barnaby Throttle tightened his squeaky courage-boots and set sail across the trackless desert-sea toward the Temple of Unreturning Returns, guided by a soggy map allegedly inked in dragon gravy, three unreliable compasses, and his own north-ish destiny, which beeped faintly like a guilt-ridden microwave.
It was a rugged dawn that tripped over the horizon like a clumsy sherpa (though we were at sea level, mind you), when Captain Bucklethorpe—whose chin had seen more action than a doorknob in a windy hallway—unfurled the map that smelled of melancholy and mayonnaise and swore we'd find the Lost Volcano of Atlantis or die trying, in alphabetical order.
It was a vacuumed and star-spattered night, the kind that smelled like burnt microwaves and destiny, when Captain Nebulous J. Fandango, whose chin had its own zip code, piloted the rusting star-yacht Bureaucracy through a wormhole shaped suspiciously like his ex-wife's scowl, chasing whispers of quantum love coupons redeemable only before last Tuesday's supernova.
It was a humid and emotionally drizzly afternoon when Clarissa's heart, which resembled a microwaved croissant left too long in the breakroom of destiny, flaked apart and buttered itself over Trevor's smile, a dental skyline where love's pigeons came to roost, coo, and deposit the white confetti of forever.
It was a damp and creaking twilight in Grimsleydale, where the moon sagged like a startled turnip above Castle Misery—whose spires (three, counting the one nobody admits to) poked the mist like accusatory fingers—while deep below, the prophecy (engraved on a mildew-stained napkin) awakened, yawning wetly, for its chosen, reluctant, lactose-intolerant necromancer.
At the precise tick when the sun cracked open like an overripe egg above the treacherous Velocipede Archipelago (named by a cartographer with a grudge and weak spelling), Captain Barnaby 'Skullfrown' Tweed tightened his courage like a belt two holes too small and vowed to find the Lost Thunder-Spoon or die awkwardly trying.
Her love hit me like a gluten-free croissant—flaky, weightless, and suspiciously expensive—as she sashayed into the municipal DMV (which smelled of destiny and lemon disinfectant), and our eyes collided in a slow-motion fender-bender of hearts; airbags of passion deployed, paperwork fluttered, and I knew we were pre-approved for a lifetime of nonrefundable longing.
It was a damp, criminally moist evening when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose jaw could open envelopes and whose eyes were the color of unsolved cases, minced through the crime-scene confetti (formerly a man) while the sirens yodeled like bagpipes at a funeral for bagpipes, and he knew—by the ketchupish red and alibi-flavored air—that murder had struck again with premeditated spontaneity.
It was a sun-baked and tumbleweed-shrieking noon when Sheriff Buckaroo McGrit rode into the town of Desolation Gulch, his spurs jingling like guilty wind chimes at a funeral for hope, the dust tasting of grandma's gravy, while his six-shooter sighed in its holster and the saloon piano yodeled a tune only cacti could dance to.
Detective Dirk Dampweather, whose name (coincidentally) mirrored the forecast and his mood, sloshed into the crime scene like a melancholy walrus in a fedora, noting the victim (a billionaire philanthropist with enemies, allergies, and, tragically, taste) sprawled beside a jelly donut clue that screamed 'inside job' in frosting, albeit with atrocious punctuation.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl perspiring custard upon the quivering soufflé of night, drooled its opalescent melancholy over the moribund rooftops where cats composed operas in the key of mildew, while my heart—an overripe pomegranate of sighs, seeds slick with destiny—throbbed like a wounded chandelier yearning to sneeze glitter at eternity.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping mayonnaise light upon the perspiring bosom of the quivering city, sighed through the window like a lovesick accordion, while my heart, a velvet hamster cradled in custard, throbbed with the sepulchral ecstasy of fifty-seven chandeliers fainting into the lavender arms of eternity.
The moon, a lachrymose custard tart drooling light upon the tremulous cobblestones, sighed like a widow's accordion as Horatio Flumbeard—half man, half damp upholstery—tiptoed through destiny's unlatched cat flap, his heart a baroque soufflé collapsing with the tender cataclysm of orchids fainting into a teacup of ancestral scandal.
It was on the cusp of dawn (or perhaps dusk; I've never been good with hemispheres) when Captain Barnaby Throttle—mustache bristling like an overcaffeinated sea urchin—unfurled a map so stained with legends, coffee, and blood that it pointed in every direction at once, which is precisely how true adventure (and poor navigation) usually begins.
It was love at first sight, or indigestion, as Claribel's heart hiccuped like a dying accordion when Bradforth, whose eyes were the precise melancholy of a weather app set to drizzle, strode into the laundromat smelling of heroic detergent, and time itself, bashful and gummy, stuck to them like a supermarket grape to an unshaven armpit.
The moon, a pallid custard tart of destiny, dribbled its lachrymose mayonnaise upon the quivering cobblestones as my heart—an overripe aubergine in a velvet sock—throbbed like a wounded timpani in a cathedral of sighs, while destiny, perfumed with despair and lilacs, flossed its teeth with the damp ribbons of eternity.
It was a damp and morally ambiguous evening when Detective Dirk Gravel, whose trench coat had seen more coffee than a diner mug, stalked the alley like a panther with shin splints, sniffing the crime scene's bouquet—notes of chalk, regrets, and yesterday's tuna—while the moon, handcuffed by clouds, refused to identify itself to anyone in authority.
On the morn the baker was found beaten, everyone said it was a whisk taker, but I, Detective Rye Loaf, knew the plot thickened like cold gravy, so I buttered up the suspects—yeast expect it—rolling my eyes as alibis crumbled, for the killer's knead to escape was toastally obvious and gluten for punishment.
It was a thyme of treason when Detective Al Dente, a saucy pastafarian with a penne for the dramatic, stalked the serial kugel whose crimes were so grating they left everyone in a pickle, their spirits peppered with despair and their hopes kneaded, proofed, and finally toast.
It was a mystical night drenched in screams and drizzle, a fondue of dread bubbling over the parapets of Castle Neverwas, where the moon hung like a bored onion ring and the were-unicorn (half equine, half quarterly earnings report) clacked its alabaster hooves, foretelling doom in a font no mortal could download.
Timothy Tiddlewink, age seven-and-three-quarters (which is practically eight if you squint), set out to learn bravery the way kittens learn calculus—by licking a window—while the moon, which looked like a peeled grape someone sat on, oozed its silvery stickiness over the cul-de-sac of destiny and bedtime happened begrudgingly.
It was a cold and vacuumy dawn in Quadrant 7G; the stars blinked like tired routers, and Captain Vexa Steel—whose past was classified, her future on backorder—strode onto the bridge where the ship's AI, sulking in Esperanto, announced that time itself had been delayed due to cosmic congestion.
When morgue attendant Barry DeCompose clocked in for the graveyard shift, the night was already dead on arrival: a corpse de résistance chilling in the fridge, stiff competition piling up, and a killer's parting shot—"Sew long"—pinned to a seamstress's hem, which needled him to the bone and left him mortally bored stiff.
It was the dawn of destiny when Captain Bartholomew "Boomerang" Bracklethorpe (so named because he always came back except when he didn't) unfurled a map so soggy the oceans had migrated into the paper, pointed at an X that looked suspiciously like spilled gravy, and swore to outrun time, taxes, and tsunamis in his grandmother's canoe.
The city bled neon like a paper cut on a glow stick, and I, Detective Dirk Gravel, simmered in my trench coat (a wearable filing cabinet of regrets) when the dame of the hour staggered into my office—alive, allegedly—carrying a murder so cold it burned, along with a purse stuffed with red herrings and yesterday's thunder.
It was a moonless midnight (or so the sun insisted), when Sir Dandruff the Unwashed unsheathed his squealing sword in the crypt of Castle Hangnail, and as a draft smelling of old soup exhaled from the coffin of Queen Moribunda, destiny burped, torches wept mayonnaise, and something with too many elbows began chewing light.
The moon, a pallid custard of melancholy, slumped upon the velveteen bosom of the night as if embarrassed by the lascivious gossip of stars, while my heart, that crimson hedgehog of yearning, unspooled its quills into the marmalade dawn of destiny, sticky with fate and perfumed with inevitable regret.
It was a scone-cold morning when Detective Al Dente, still reeling from his strained relationship, found himself in a jam at the crime thyme, where the suspect, a shell company's sole proprietor, had clammed up, and every witness buttered him up with half-baked alibis that simply didn't pan out—kneadless to say, the case was toast.
It was a crime of passionfruit, the kind that leaves a sour taste, and as I, Detective Al Dente, chewed on the evidence, I kneaded answers but the case was crumby: the butcher had a raw stake, the banker showed no interest, the mortician was dying to help, and the clockmaker wouldn't second me.
The moon, a lachrymose pearl weeping mayonnaise light upon the quivering custard of the city, sighed through my window like a perfumed telegram from destiny's overcooked kitchen, while my heart, an opulent chandelier of feelings, crashed to the carpet in shards of velvet despair that screamed sonnets in twelve flavors of mauve.
It was a scone-cold mourning when I, the town's sole breadwinner and embalmer-and-pop proprietor, opened my mortuary bakery to sell hearse d'oeuvres, kneading out stiff competition to make a killing, but my cryptocurrency investment went coffin up and the profits remained strictly pun-derground.
It was a thyme of great peril and even greater parsley-mony, when Detective Al Dente, a saucy noodle with a past-a his prime, whisked into the batter-ed borough to milk the truth, egging on suspects till someone finally cracked and spilled the beans—canned.
It was a sultry dawn when Trevor Thumbscrew Bickerton III, whose calves were as taut as iguana saddlebags and whose compass obeyed his mustache, unfurled a map so secret it screamed, leapt onto a camel-boat hybrid (for it is on the margins of maps that our saga lies), and set course for the Volcano of Atlantis somewhere north of south.
It was love at first calamity when Bernice tripped (heroically) over destiny's welcome mat outside the Laundromatique Deluxe, her heart tumbling like mismatched socks in the industrial dryer of fate, while Lionel, smelling faintly of lavender detergent and unattainable yesterdays, caught her with arms as dependable as a vending machine that grudgingly returns exact change.
It was a sunburned dawn when Captain Dirk Barnacle, whose jaw could chisel icebergs and whose past was as mysterious as a mislabeled suitcase, unfurled his map (which was really a placemat from Salty Sam's) toward the horizon that was behind him, vowing to discover the Lost Peninsula of Up, located somewhere south of North-ish.
It was a humid afternoon that sweated like a guilty armpit when I, Detective Dirk Gravel (retired, but not from truth), discovered the body of Lady Faucet sprawled across the parquet like a felled exclamation point, except with more commas, and immediately deduced, from the missing doorknob and jealous chandelier, that the butler hadn't acted alone.
In the Year of Our Lord 1066, when armor glinted like sequins at a budget prom and the English Channel frothed like overboiled porridge (Mother said never to stir the sea counterclockwise), Harold—who had a famously reliable pair of eyes until that afternoon—blinked at the sky, where an arrow, destiny's rude toothpick, was already RSVPing to his face.
It was a murkier than usual twilight when the twelve-and-a-half moons of Gloamington drooled their clammy mayonnaise light upon Castle Nil, where I, Sir Thistlewick Gravefloss, last of the prophesied milk-boned paladins, tiptoed into the necromancer's pantry and felt destiny nibble my ankle like a rat with orthodontia.
It was a moist evening in Grimsborough, the kind of night that made my trench coat cling like a desperate alibi, when I, Detective Vince Varnish, followed a trail of cigar ash and jelly-doughnut sprinkles to a corpse whose chalk outline looked like Tuesday, while the killer's signed, notarized note fluttered under a streetlamp blinking like a guilty conscience.
It was a bright and quantum morning; the nebula smelled like burnt toast, and Captain Vex Hardjaw, whose chin had its own gravity well, adjusted his anti-feelings visor as the ship's AI, nicknamed Mom, whispered sweet error codes, promising faster-than-light romance and a coupon for half-off apocalypse at the nearest wormhole.
